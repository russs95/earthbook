# The Earthbook Project

<i>This is the home for the code of the Eartbook project: An open source book format for writers, readers and Earth.</i>

<h2>Publish Your Book as An Earthbook</h2>

<p>The Earthbook source code is developed from the ground up to be the greenest possible way to publish a book.  Eschewing more complex, server and developer intense languages, the Earthbook format is a simple combination of HTML and Javascript that enables anyone anywhere to publish their work in a way that embodies regenerative principles and is Earth, reader and writer friendly-- and that looks and works just as well (or better!) than reading an ePub formatted document on a mobile or eReader.</p>

<p><a href="https://book.earthen.io">LIVE EXAMPLE</a></p>

<p>The Earthbook format was developed orginally for the 'Tractatus Ayyew' and ecology theory of green developed by Russell Maier and Banayan Angway to embody the principles of their theory.</p>

<h2>Publishing your own Earthbook</h2>

<h3>Fork it</h3>
<p>This is the simplest, DIY way to go.  Using a github account, simply fork this project into your own repository.  Replace the content of the Tractatus Ayyew with your own.  According to the project's modified BY-SA Creative Commons License, be sure to reference this repository and keep the template comment mark-up for others to see and read.  The vision of the project is that the Tractatus Ayyew (which lays out the ethical framework upon which the Earthbook concept is built) will be the default sample text of for the Earthbook template.</p>
