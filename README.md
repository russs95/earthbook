# The Earthbook Repository

<i>The home of the Eartbook project: An open source book format for writers, readers and Earth.</i>

<h2>Publish Your Book as An Earthbook</h2>

<p>The Earthbook source code is developed from the ground up to be replicated to enable anyone anywhere to publish their work in a way that emobdies regenerative principles and is Earth, reader and writer friendly.  You may do so on your own, or enlist the help of the Earthbook developer team to do so for you.  Either way, a completed, ready-t0-go manuscript is required!</p>

<h3>Fork it</h3>
<p>This is the simplest, DIY way to go.  Using a github account, simply fork this project into your own repository.  Replace the content of the Tractatus Ayyew with your own.  According to the project's modified BY-SA Creative Commons License, be sure to reference this repository and keep the template comment mark-up for others to see and read.  The vision of the project is that the Tractatus Ayyew (which lays out the ethical framework upon which the Earthbook concept is built) will be the default sample text of for the Earthbook template.</p>
