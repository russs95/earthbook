     <div class="lead-page-paragraph">
        IN SHARP CONTRAST TO KINCENTRIC NATIONS ANCIENT AND ONGOING, our modern view of the world is based solely on the teachings of our fellow humans. From philosophers to prophets, priests to kings, scientists to seers, human teachers have entirely shaped our modern understanding and relationship to ‘the natural world’.  Upon this way of knowing, we have established the means by which we discern good from bad, right from wrong, green from grey— and, incidentally, centered our modern ideologies upon fulfilling human needs over those of all Earth's other inhabitants. However practical and successful this paradigm has been for the prosperity of humanity, it has wholly failed to achieve the ecological harmony we so long for today. 
     </div>

    <div class="page-paragraph">

    <p>As we saw in our last chapter, kincentric nations were founded on an altogether different way of knowing.  Rather than learning solely from humans, these societies recognized the plants and animals around them as kin, elders, and teachers.  Today, as we come to recognize the connection between their kincentric knowing and the pattern of ecological enrichment inherent to their cultures, we can glimpse the pattern of depletion within our own— and isolate the ontological error that distorts our modern view of the world. </p>

      <p>From Greek stories of human-gods ruling the world, to Roman legends of humans dominating it, western society has put humans upon a pedestal.  From early astronomers declaring that the sun spun around the earth, to biblical interpretations declaring man’s dominion over it and all its creatures, humanity’s centrality and exceptionalism has become lodged in the depths of western collective consciousness.  Over the centuries, as modern philosophy, religion, ethics and science have evolved they have built layer upon layer on top of this ancient foundation.  </p>


      <p>Today, we know better.</p>

      <p>After centuries of science, biologists have long dismissed that humans are at the top of life’s tree and astronomers have long disproved that the Earth is the center of the cosmos.  In this, contemporary science and ancient kincentricism align.  Both agree that humans, plants and animals all share ancestry and origins, action and consequence, connection and dependence.  Both concur that, no organism is central or separate to the others: like a tapestry each and every are inextricable parts of the whole.   </p>

      <p>However despite unequivocal dismissal, the axioms of man’s centrality and separateness have remained and persisted, buried in the depths of our modern ideologies.  Just as cities are built upon the forgotten foundations of structures that came long before, these ancient errors tilt and incline our modern intellectual edifices that continue to stand upon them today.</p>

      <p>From capitalism to communism, fascism to feminism, our modern views of the world remain moored in human exceptionalism.  Even though they claim vast differences and boast scientific savvy, their underlying cosmological foundations overlap in the same archaic axioms.</p>

      <p>Nowhere is this more clear than in the way our modern ideologies speak of ecosystems.   From neoliberalism and socialism, from libertarianism to deep ecology, the very language that they use to describe the ‘natural world’ that they so long to love, most reveals their rusted moorings in ancient human-centric assumptions.</p>

      <p>In modern terminology, there is no word more imbued with the cumbersome weight of ancient metaphysical misconception than that of nature.    This term, used so poetically by environmentalists to compel conservation and protection of ‘the natural’ world, is alas seeped in irredeemable dualistic fallacy:  the ancient error of delineating man and nature, culture and ecology,  the natural and the human.</p>

      <p id="47-up">Upon this stark division not only is modern society built, but so too our most fervent environmental attempts and endeavors.  Derived from the Middle-English term environ, meaning to circle or surround, ‘the environment’ has come to mean, that which is around us humans, but not that which is us.<a href="#footnotes">⁴⁷</a></p>

      <p id="48-up">Over the last decades, feminists<a href="#footnotes">⁴⁸</a>, theologians<a href="#footnotes">⁴⁹</a> and philosophers<a href="#footnotes">⁵⁰</a> have observed that the modern environmental ethics that results from this foundation (laws, sustainability guidelines, UN goals, etc.) are thus locked into a perspective of human-time, human-space and human-needs, and consequently: of human rights, interests and economy. From this view, ‘nature’ is inevitably objectified as something with which humanity is ever interacting: managing, dominating, stewarding. Our ‘green’ endeavors that follow, thus strive to reduce their harm, to protect and to conserve the ‘natural’ world from human touch and contamination.</p>
      
      <p>Alas, from this reasoning, the notion of human ecological contribution is an impossibility.  As such it has remained all but unimagined by environmentalists and industrialists alike.</p>

     <p id="51-up">Banayan and I observe that not only is the human-centric axiom of this logic  flawed, its conclusions run contrary to the lived and ancestral experience of her people and that of countless other kincentric nations ancient and ongoing:  cultures in which the concept of ‘nature’ is both absent and fundamentally antithetical.<a href="#footnotes">⁵¹</a></p>

     <p>Banayan and I also observe that the effort of preserving and protecting ‘nature’ is likewise doomed to the very fate it aims to avoid.  Conserving and protecting one part of a system (i.e. an organism or ecosystem) at the exclusion of others, in the end, always fails.  As the neighboring parts degrade, so too will the whole, and with it, inevitably, so too all its parts.</p>

     <p>To move forward towards authentic green contributions, we must thus first thoroughly excise human exceptionalism and its crooked conclusions from our view of the world.</p>

     <p>To do so, the concept of ‘nature’ must crumble like the ancient rusted chain that it is.</p>

     <p>Only then, can we shatter the mind forged manacles of antiquated, anthropocentric cosmology and open the door to the ecological regeneration to which our moment so urgently calls.</p>

     <p>Only then can we too see the plants and animals around us as kin, elders and masters of ecological integration– teachers that we can learn from to vitalize our own regenerative potential.</p>

     <p>And only then can we see that the greatest teacher of all has been awaiting us all a long.</p>

        <div class="footnote-text">Russell received a personal account from Robert Muller, three time under-secretary of general of the UN, who in discussions with UN Secretary General U Thant during the 1960’s, selected the word ‘environment’ (which had no political meaning at the time) as a term for the world’s growing ecological concerns. The term was used for the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, in Stockholm, giving ‘environmentalism’ its modern political meaning.</div>
