<div class="lead-page-paragraph">
    <p id="en-1-4-00">
    OVER THE LAST FOUR BILLION YEARS, the singular combination of our planet's orbit, spin, composition and chemistry has played out.  As this unique configuration of matter and energy has unfolded, a once barren rock has transformed into the thriving biosphere that is our common home today.  Of all that we know of other planets in our solar system and galaxy, it is an extraordinary and epic story.  However, even more remarkable, the telling of the tale is now part of the story itself.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="page-paragraph">

<p id="en-1-4-01">The telling of Earth's tale is only possible through a vast and unique confluence of matter and energy; the spiral of carbon into ever more concentrated and complex configurations, the dispersion of the sun's energy into ever more diverse organisms and ecosystems; and through it all the inexorable unfolding of sentience in a myriad of forms.  Powered by ancient compacted carbon, our last centuries of civilization and science have been able to illuminate both Earth’s story and our own.</p>

  <p id="en-1-4-2">From this vast vantage we must revisit our judgments of ourselves and of plastic.</p>


  <p id="en-1-4-3">Rather than be mired in despair at our modern moment of ecological depletion we can be awed by Earth’s momentous act of ecological enrichment.</p>

  <p id="26-up">The way our planet— <i>as a uniquely configured cosmological system</i>— has managed its matter and energy has led to the steady greening of its surface; the cultivation of ever greater diversity, vibrancy and abundance.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Going forward we will refer to Earth in ways that imply agency (i.e. “Earth managed its matter”). While it is more than possible to conceive Earth as a sentient entity, a divine being, or the active creation of a divine being(s), such claims are beyond the scope of this essay. Instead we imply agency simply in as much as any singular self-contained system has its own unique patterns, character and tendencies.  i.e. “Big Ben kept time”, “Everest stood tall”, “Uranus spins slowly around the sun”.">²⁶</a>  And finally, through the resulting emergence of consciousness, we have been propelled to pondering the process itself.</p>

  <p id="en-1-4-04">So, where do we go from here?</p>

  <p id="en-1-4-05">First, let us hold fast to our vantage and the vast view it affords.</p>

  <p id="27-up">From here we can observe another pivotal planetary phenomenon. Aside from meteor strikes and massive volcanoes, it is a phenomenon unseen on the planet for millions of years.  Due to the doings of modern humanity, it has been eons since Earth’s processes, cycles and systems so abruptly added more carbon into the atmosphere than they removed.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="'The present atmospheric content [of CO2] exceeds anything Earth has experienced in the last million years and possibly the last 20 million years' David Beerling, 'The Emerald Planet' (Oxford University Press, 2017).">²⁷</a></p>

  <p id="en-1-4-06">The ensuing decline of the vitality and diversity of the biosphere is a direct challenge to our last century of carbon play.</p>

  <p id="en-1-4-07">Much like a child building with blocks for the first time, we have much to learn from our moment. All too often, youngsters are swept away by the thrill of assembling a grand construction. However, when the pieces inevitably tumble down; when the results aren’t as intended; the upset child invariably blames themselves and the blocks.</p>

  <p id="en-1-4-08">Of course, neither are to blame.</p>
  
  <p id="en-1-4-09">Only through the first fall can one grasp the process of the play.</p>

  <p id="en-1-4-10">There is no other way.</p>

 <p id="28-up">Likewise, our disruption of ecological cycles is not a consequence of our nature any more than it is the nature of carbon or oxygen.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Are humans inherently destructive or contributory?  Competitive or collaborative?  In the chapters ahead, we take a firm position in this ongoing debate:  in discarding the empirically and rationally untenable view of humans as central and exceptional to the biosphere, and instead as subsets systems within it, our Earthen character becomes clear.  See:  Rutger Bregman, 'Humankind: A Hopeful History' (Little, Brown and Company, 2019).">²⁸</a>  Rather, it is the way of our play: the fundamental pattern by which our processes have managed their energy and their matter. </p>

 <p id="29-up">As we saw in plastic’s story, our modern processes have increasingly intended patterns of energy and matter that have dispersed carbon, concentrated energy, degraded diversity and stifled awareness.  In sharp contrast, Earth's processes have tended towards just the opposite:  the concentration of carbon, the dispersal of energy, the increase of diversity and the cultivation of consciousness. Whereas our modern pattern of process has degraded ecosystems, Earth’s has systematically enriched them— making them ever more diverse, vibrant and abundant.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Here and throughout the Tractatus Ayyew, we refer to the cumulative four billion years of the Earth’s history. Over the full period of Earth’s history, there have been tremendous swings in the abundance and diversity of the biosphere– extinctions, depletion and lulls where for millions of years life was severely stifled. However, despite these declines, we observe that on the whole the net-biodiversity and abundance of the biosphere has steadily increased.  We will examine each facet of the planet’s net-enrichment in the five chapters of book 2.">²⁹</a></p>

 <p id="30-up">Like a despairing determined child on a second-go at block building, we’re trying harder than ever. With a shame at our failings, we have our heads down, striving valiantly to build stronger and higher: to make our processes less harmful, less polluting, less degrading, less grey. However, no matter how hard we have striven, our polluting has increased unabated: over time, any improvements in the efficiency of our grey processes have been inevitably eclipsed by their proliferation. For with the underlying grey pattern of our processes unchanged, even if they are less depleting— <i>depleting they remain</i>.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Hope is often placed on increases in efficiency to decrease the cumulative environmental impact of human processes (i.e. “more efficient coal powered steam engines will decrease London’s pollution”). However, historically, advances in technological efficiency have in fact resulted in increased environmental impact.  This is known as Jevon’s Paradox: as efficiency increases, so too does the adoption and spread of the technology, inevitably leading to a net-increase in environmental impact.  Our argument is complimentary: we observe that processes, cycles and systems have an inherent pattern that will unfold regardless of efficiency or scale.">³⁰</a></p>

 <p id="en-1-4-11">Banayan and I have come to see that it is time to raise our heads from the toil.</p>

 <p id="en-1-4-12">And the judgment.</p>

 <p id="en-1-4-13">Again, rather than despair, we can be awed.</p>

 <p id="en-1-4-14">Our once-in-a-million-years phenomenon of additive carbon usage is in fact a tremendous opportunity.</p>

 <p id="en-1-4-15">For the first time, with our usage of carbon as a foil, the difference between our modern ways and Earth’s can be observed with unprecedented clarity.  In the stark contrast of patterns, we can begin to discern the planetary cosmological character that has propelled the inexorable transformation of a barren rock into a thriving biosphere: the pattern by which Earth has managed its matter and energy through processes, cycles and systems towards the enrichment of all.</p>

 <p id="en-1-4-15-2">And in a similar way, through our modern society’s ecological dissonance, so too can our modern gaze now recognize those societies—  ancient and ongoing— that have long attained resonance with Earth’s pattern and character.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="See Banayan’s work laying out a the context and definition of the Igorot Ayyew Ethos:  Banayan Angway, 'Cordillera Administrative Region Indigenous Peoples Education Curriculum K-12' (Bontoc, Mountain Prov., CAR; Philippines Department of Education, 2014).">³¹</a></p>

 <p id="en-1-4-16">Nations that just by thriving, enriched the vitality, diversity and abundance of the ecosystems of which they were part.</p>

 <p id="en-1-4-17">Nations that— just like Earth— cultivated common homes for one and for all.</p>
