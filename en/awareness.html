  Observing the lush verdant splendor above, it is easy to overlook that the secret to the forest’s well-being lies below.

  Affectionately known by scientists as the ‘wood wide web’, 


  Within a forest, an intricate web of life exists, with trees and various organisms coexisting in a delicate balance. Beneath the soil, mycorrhizal fungi play a crucial role in facilitating communication and nutrient exchange between trees. These fungal networks connect tree roots, enabling them to share resources, information, and warnings about potential threats. In doing so, these fungi create a complex system that enhances the awareness of individual trees and, by extension, the entire forest. This interconnectedness mirrors the broader process that has unfolded over Earth's history, cultivating a steadily more aware biosphere.

  .  As an individual gains and abundance or a deficit of a particular nutrient, through the network this can be sensed.  Rather than wait to soak of nitrogen or phosphorous from the soil, the tree can seek (or share) it with its neighbours. As trees share nutrients, they also share valuable information. The rates a tree takes and gives tells the others about itself and its environment.

  In doing so, these fungi create a complex system that enhances the awareness of individual trees and, by extension, the entire forest.

  Through their roots they can also share resources, information, and warnings about potential threats.

  , the Often, these signals can result in forest wide adaptions — such as the collective release of defensive toxins to fend off an infestation. 

  Douglas fir attacked by insects alerts its neighbours by a sudden shift in its pattern of give and take.

        Beneath the mossy floor of North American temperate forests lies an intricate network exchanging the needs and nutrients of its trees.  Coursing through the soil, a multitude of fungal species attach to the roots of Spruce, Firs, Poplars and Pines. From one tree to another, these mycorrhizal fungi weave thin threads that interconnect the forest like a fiber-optic web. As the night falls, as the moon ebbs, as the seasons change, the mycelium tapestry allows  individual trees to sense the give and take of their networked neighbours.  A Birch catching the morning sun through a break in the canopy informs the others by a surge of sugars flowing into its roots. A Spruce short on water lets its neighbours know by drawing more heavily on the network.   A Douglas fir attacked by insects alerts its neighbours by a sudden shift in its pattern of give and take.  As each individual signals and senses, the collective mutualistically adapts to both cycles and events in their environment.  As each individual integrates, so too does it flourish— and with it the collective resiliency, vibrancy and abundance of the forest.</i>

    THE WAY THAT a forest and its fungal work together to enrich both the parts and the whole of their ecosystem provides us with our fifth and final Earthen ethic.  Already embodying our first four ethics, temperate forests and their mycorrhirzal networks exemplify the enriching spiral of matter and energy tending towards ever more diverse organisms and ever more vibrant, resilient and abundant ecosystems.  However, the intricate 'wood wide web' (as scientists affectionately call it), reveals a further, all encompassing phenomenon. As we shall see, the tendency by which the fungal forests steadily increase their awareness is a microcosm of the billion year process by which Earth has transformed from barren to biosphere.  By looking closely at how this distinctly Earthen pheonomon has unfolded over our planet's history, we shall lay out our fith and final Earthen ethic.  With the help of the principle of 'awaring' (as we will affectionately call it)<a href="#footnotes" title="Alas there is no verb for the noun 'aware' in the English language.  As the action of bringing awareness is a fundamental component of not just this ethic, but Earthen ethics in general, we will be using the term 'awaring' throughout the Tractatus in reference to the concept outlined in this chapter." onclick="openFootnotes()">¹</a> we can not only ensure that our enterprise are green, we can make them greener and greener.

        AS WE ENDEAVOUR TO understand the parameters of ecological contribution we arrive at the fifth facet of Earth's cosmological character.  Thus far we have observed that Earthen process tend towards ecological enrichment through the sprial cycle of matter and energy towards ever increasing vitality and diversity.  Our fifth Earth ethic, encapsulates the entire dynamic, precipitating a phenonomenon which sets Earth apart from all its fellow planets in the solar system: consciousness.  More specifically: <i>an ever increasing awareness of one's connection to others and the cycles of life As we shall see, the tendency towards steadily increasingly ecological awareness, is a fundamental aspect of Earth's character-- of which the mycorrhizal forest is a magnificient example.  By looking closely at both, we shall see how the communication of give and take allow Earthen systems to steadily deepen their harmony with Earth's cycles.</i>.  
    
    move to book three:

 <p>As we shall see, the way in which Earthen systems cyclically share their give and take of nutrients with each other, increases the health, resiliency and abundance of both organism and ecosystem.  This dynamic of 'awaring' is an example that our modern enterprises may follow to ensure that they too are green.  Through impact accounting and cyclical disclosure, this final Earthen ethic, encompasses each of the other four.  With its help we can not only ensure that our enterprise are green, we can begin to steadily make them greener and greener.</p>-->

        <p>To begin, let us return one more time to Earth's primordial story.</p>


        <p>A billion years ago, Earth's surface was a barren, desolate place.  However, as we saw in Earth's <a href="stellar.html">stellar story</a> the materials cycles on its surface adapted to ever better disperse the Sun's shine.  Steadily, our planet's unique cosmological character tended its cycles and systems towards ever more effective dissipations of solar energy.<a href="#footnotes" title="Entropy research by theoretical physicists posit a pattern of adaptive dissipation in the way matter organizes itself in the presence of sustained energy inputs. Meanwhile, parallel breakthroughs in cosmological epistemology help make sense of Earth’s unfolding kinetic character. Jeremy L.

        <!-- <p>We also observed, that over human history certain nations have excelled at follow                                                                ing Earth's example by emobodying these principles into their culture and values.   We saw that these nations centerered thier society on the cycles of not just the moon and the sun, but of the great creatures with which they shared space.</p>

        <p>Underlying the pattern of ecological enrichment of these nations and of the mycorrhizal forest, is a deep and abiding awareness of the cycles of life, the give and take of nutrients of each.</p>

        <p>Indeed, it precisely such an awareness that was key to the flourishing of life on planet Earth.</p> -->


        <p>As early cellular systems emerged, fundamental to their flourishing was a sensitivity to respond and adapt to changes in their environment.  In particular: <i>those that cyclically repeat.</i><a href="#footnotes" title="'In life, most molecular assemblies exist out of equilibrium, driven by energy harvested from reaction cycles.''

         <p>As plants emerged, they built upon this primal awareness.  Ferns learned to open their stomata during the day and closing them at night to conserve water.  Trees learned when in the year to drop their leaves and when to build them.  Conifers learned to sync the ebb and flow of their sap with the pull and push of lunar cycles.</p>
          
          <p>As ferns, palms, conifers and others of all kinds proliferate, a second tier of organisms came to survive upon the first.  They did so by developing a sensitivity to the oscillations of the green beings whom they depended.   Early insects came to sense and sync their reproductive cycle with the blooming cycles of flowering plants. Birds came to sense and sync their movements with to the seasonal fruiting patterns of certain plants. Moths and bats sensed and synced with the cycles of flowers and insects that emerged with the moon.<a href="#footnotes" title="'Circadian clocks enhance the innate ability of organisms to survive under ever-changing environments by enabling them to efficiently anticipate periodic events such as availability of food, light and mates' Paranjpe DA, Sharma VK.

          <p>As organisms fell into webs of independence, the more organisms were aware of the cycles of their fellows, they more they could all adapt. However, this meant more than just sensing their environment, but also signaling to each other.  The clearer the signal that its fruit were ripe, the better a tree could share and distribute its seeds.  The better a bee could sense a plant's flowers, the more effectively it could find food.  The more effectively a fungal thread could find roots seeking nitrogen, them more effectively it could access its sugars and share its nitrogen.  As both sense and signal spiraled into countless channels of communication and compensation, the awareness of individuals and of the collective steadily augmented, both above and below the ground.</p>

          <p>Here, the temperate forests of today stand as a magnificent Earthen microcosm.</p>

          <p>In the same way that Earth's early organisms developed a greater and greater environmental awareness to mutualistically thrive and vitalize Earth's surface, so too do the inhabitants of the mycorrhizal forest mutualistically thrive and vitalize their shared space.</p>
          
          <p>And in the same way that early Earthen systems learned to sense and signal environmental cycles, by signaling and sensing the give and take of their fellow trees, the mycorrhizal forest syncs, adapts and optimizes as a collective.  From the yellow of flower to the greenness of a bud, from the fragrance of sap to the form of a fungal fruit, every aspect of the forest informs of ripeness and readiness, health and disease, fertility and death in order that organisms can share resources, warn of threats, and adapt to changing conditions.  And as their mutual awareness deepens, so too does their sync with the ebb and flow of the cycles at the base of it all.</p>
            
            <p>As day turns to night, and winter turns to summer, as the moon changes its phase, the entire ecosystem undulates; mutualistically maximizing its collective conversion of solar shine into nutrients for the benefit of all.<a href="#footnotes" title="'Closed ecosystems extract energy through self-organized nutrient cycles', A Goyal, AI Flamholz, AP Petroff, A Murugan

        <p>The cyclical spiral of awaring of Earth and Forest are examples that we can follow today.</p>
            
<!--             
            from mutual dependencies to arise and coodinated responses to occur-- and from this the verdant abundance, biological diversity and vibrant living that characterize the surface of our planet.</p>
          
          <p>Just as Earth</p>
            
            
            
            
            As verdant networks of both interdependance and inter-awaring, mycorhizal forests are seeped in sensistivity and signaling. The aspect of every leaf, root and mycellial thread are in themselves cues that communicate.  </p>
            
            Filled with insects and animals, plants and trees, all sensitive to these signals, each makes the others aware by sensing and signaling their give and take; their needs and nutrients.  And as their mutual awareness deepens, so too does their sync with the ebb and flow of the cycles at the base of it all.  
            
          
          <p>Both the mycorrizal forest and the evolution of Earth's early inhabitants underscore the role of awaring in our planet's process.</p>
            
         -->
          
          
      <p>Just like a tree within a forest, our human enterprises give and take from the ecosystems in which they are immersed.  As we saw in our second Earthen ethic, our human enterprises are subset systems of the planet's biosphere.  The material resources they require, move and transform effect both local ecosystems and the global biosphere.  Furthermore the financial energy that our enterprises use is inextricably interconnected with ecological effects.  In this way, just as some trees establish a characteristic pattern of give and take, so too do our enterprises.</p>
      
      <p>Today, as we strive to ensure our human enterprises are green, Trees and Earth show us the way forward. Just as Earth tends its processes towards awareness, so too can we can intend with our own. When our enterprises cyclically share their ecological give and take, then the awareness of all is augmented. Such enterprises, by fulfilling this and the other four Earthen ethics, can then be considered to be an ecological contribution, and green.</p>

      <p>Conversely, no matter how green an enterprise may seem, if it fails to fully inform how it is green, it fails to be green.</p>
      
      <p>After all...</p> 
      
      
    <!-- <p>A product may appear green because it is made with up-cycled material— but it may have no plan for its own next cycle.</p> -->

    <p>A product may be marketed as 'green' because it is made with organic material— but a forest may have been cut for the crop.</p>
    <!-- <p>A service may be marketed as zero-waste— yet tons of carbon may have been emited for the energy in its offering.</p> -->
    
    <p>An organization may operate as a not-for-profit— yet the spaces that it presides over may be barren of biodiversity.</p>

    <!-- <p>An enterprise may preside over the planting of thousands of trees— yet operate as for-profit.</p> -->

    <p>A service may have been made with net-zero emissions— yet tons of carbon may have been dispersed in its shipping.</p>

    <p>Or not.</p>
    
    <p>Simply put, without a comprehensive disclosure of all its ecological gives and takes, how can we know the true character of a process?</p>

    <p>Whether it is direct concealment or simply a failure of an enterprise to account and know their own impact for themselves, as deleterious as the unshared impact may be, equally so is the failure to have made it known. In so far as the consealment (intentional or not) decreases the ecological awareness of those involved, it directly impedes mutualist adaption:  Without accurate knowledge of an enterprises ecological impact, humans seeking to entrain their own cycles and systems to the benefit the biosphere, will make mistakes in their energy allocations: purchasing products, soliciting services or working for enterprises that are taking more than they give.</p>

    <p>Thus, when evaluating the greenness of an act, product or process we must ask: Is the enterprise raising the ecological consciousness of all those involved?  Has the enterprise undertaken a comprehensive disclosure of all its ecological give and and takes?</p>
    
    <p>In short: is the full ecological character of the enterprise being made known?</p>

    <p>Here, character is key.</p>
  
  <p>As we have seen throughout the <i>Tractatus</i>, Earth’s greening of the biosphere was characterized by five fundamental principles. To know an enterprises ecological character, a comprehensive disclosure of an enterprise's ecological give and take must account for each of the Earthen principles.  To the extent that an enterprise embodies these five facets of ecological contribution, we can evaluate it shade of green.</p>
    
    <!-- <p>In short: Is the enterprise following Earth's example of raising awareness of how it is following Earth's example?</p>

    <p>Today, more and more of our enterprises are taking steps to account for their ecological impacts and to disclose them.  While this is an important step in the right direction, unless an enterprise is following Earth's example in raising ecological awareness, it will fail to be an ecological contribution-- and green.</p> -->



    <div class="page-paragraph" style="padding:15px">

      <p id="en-1-7-04">1. <i>An enterprise discloses its plan for the cyclical spiral of its products or services in a way that ecologically enrich (defined by the numerical balances of facets 2, 3, 4).</i></p>
  
      <p id="en-1-7-05">2. <i>An enterprise discloses its spiral of financial energy out to the benefit of people and planet.</i></p>

      <p id="en-1-7-06">3. <i>An enterprise discloses the spiral of its principal elements (such as carbon) towards concentration and sequestration.</i></p>

      <p id="en-1-7-08">5. <i>An enterprises expresses and realizes its commitment of cyclical disclosure (i.e. daily, quarterly, annually, etc.) of facets 1-4.</i></p>
</div>


    <p>Through such a five faceted ecological accounting and disclosure, the color of our enterprises, products and processes will scintillate like a tree’s Spring buds — a vivid green a beacon to eyes weary of a long grey winter.</p>

    <p>A sandal maker can declare its plan to re-use automobile tire for its soles, then recover the rubber at the shoe's end and sequester them — and proudly report at the end of the year the results.</p>

    <p>A web-server provider can declare its for-Earth business structure— and proudly report each year the results of their annual impact sequestering carbon and supporting biodiversity in their spaces.</p>

    <p>A swim-wear maker can proudly declare its for-Earth business priority— along with its plan for the sequestration of its polyesters and its net-carbon subtraction for the year.</p>

    <p>A dress maker can proudly declare how its organic fabric is biodegradable — and also the biodiversity its space has supported that year.</p>

    <p>A book author can declare their intention to support raise ecological consciousness — and share the impact their enterprise and space at the end of each year.</p>

    <p>With renewed confidence, we can then choose to work for or buy from such enterprises, sure of the color, character and the well-being vitalized. With our support, such enterprises can steadily increase their give to vastly exceed their take — for their well being, ours and everyone’s.</p>

    <p>This full embodiment of the five principles of Earthen ethics is what we shall call a for-Earth process of human enterprise.</p>

    <p>Powered by humanity's rising planet passion such <i>Earth Enterprises</i> are uniquely poised to transform even the most dire systemic pollutions from spirals of depletion into spirals of enrichment.</p>

    <p>Starting with our modern management of plastic.</p>

































<!-- 
    <p>Just like a tree within a forest, our human enterprises give and take from the ecosystems in which they operate.  The resources they require or the products and by-products that they create all have ecological impacts themselves.  Accounting for, and publically disclosing these impacts for both the enterprise and everyone else to understand the ecological character of the enterprise itself.</p>

    <p>Disclosure points to the deeper direction and character of an enterprise.</p>

    <p>Indeed, authentic green all comes down to character.</p>

    <p>We can well imagine that trees, through their networked neighborhoods, can sense and discern each other. Rather than words and deeds, the character of one tree becomes clear to another by its give and take of nutrients. Perhaps it is gluttonous with its glucose or finicky with its phosphorus. Perhaps it is caring with its carbon or nurturing with its nitrogen! Either way, a tree’s pattern not only let’s its neighbours know whether it is a sapling or a Spruce, but also determines the tree’s engagement with others: whether more roots and mycelium go its way, whether its nutrients flow, whether its needs are met, and indeed, whether it and the forest thrive.</p> -->





    <!-- <p>When products and services are sold, certain basic product information is provided: its price, its care-taking, its country of origin, its type of material. Often, however, green-intended enterprises do not inform of its ecological give and take. Often, information about the product’s ecological character is absent.  As we have seen in our past chapter,  its next life-cycle, its prioritization of benefit, its support of biodiversity, its carbon impacts. Without this information, there is no way to know the ecological consequences of the clothing’s consumption nor the ecological character of its creator. As such, the principle of raising awareness is not met and the clothing cannot be considered an ecological contribution — nor green.</p> -->
<!-- 
    <p>In this way, no matter how organic, up-cycled, natural or net-zero a product may be, if it fails to fully inform how it is green, it fails to be green. Its a little like judging a tree only by it’s leaves — as trees themselves know, what’s going on under the surface of the soil is far more telling.</p>

    <p>A a product may be marketed as 'green' because it is made with organically grown material — but a forest may have been cut for the cotton crop. 
    
    <p>A product may appear green because it is made with up-cycled material — but it may have no plan for its own next cycle. 
    
    <p>A product mayhave been made with net-zero emissions — yet tons of carbon may have been dispersed in its shipping.</p>

    <p>When evaluating the greenness of an act, product or process we must ask: Are the ecological impacts of the process accounted for and clearly disclosed? Has the effort been made to raise the ecological consciousness of all those involved?</p>

    <p>Often the lack of disclosure by an enterprise is simply because it is not aware of its own ecological impacts. In this way the process and effort of disclosure — counting one’s carbon, surveying one’s support of species and green space, decanting one’s principles — is essential in raising its own awareness of these very things. </p> -->
    
    <!-- After all, without the courage to face one’s own ecological impact, the effort to track it, and the discipline to manage it, how can one ever know really know it? And if one’s own impact is not known, how can it be shared with others?  -->

    <!-- <p>Here Earth calls us to aspire to the ways of the wood wide web.</p>

    <p>As we have seen, Earth’s greening of the biosphere was characterized by five fundamental principles. We can evaluate the ecological character of our own processes, acts and enterprises by how well they have embodied these Earthen principles — and in particular: by how well everyone involved is informed that they have done so.</p>

    <p>As we saw in our first principle, the Earth works in spiralling cycles that enrich. Following Earth’s example, an enterprises ensures that its products are spiral too — for instance, by making its footwear returnable, transformable or biodegradable. Then, they let everyone know! Perhaps on the sandal’s tag or by etching on its sole, the next life of the product is made clear. </p>

    <p>As we saw in our second principle, the Earth and its processes are first and foremost of benefit to the biosphere. Following the Earth’s example, a t-shirt creator makes sure to prioritize its benefit to the biosphere over its proprietary profit. Then, they let everyone know! Whether in the footer of its website or on its product’s tags, the enterprise is sure to announce its for-Earth commitment. </p>

    <p>As we saw in our third principle, the Earth and its processes concentrate carbon into sequestration over the long-term. Following the Earth’s example, a dress-maker ensures that any organic or synthetic materials used can eventually biodegrade or be sequestered. Then, they let everyone know! </p> -->

   

    <!-- <p>As we saw in our fourth principle, the Earth and its processes subtract more carbon into sequestration than they add back to the biosphere. Following the Earth’s example, a swim-wear enterprise accounts for their additive and subtractive carbon impacts. Then, they let everyone know! Whether through an annual newsletter or a tag-summary, the enterprise fully discloses their impact accounting and their net-subtraction. This way both the creator and consumer grow aware of the carbon impact they are vitalizing. -->

    <!-- <p>As we saw in our fourth principle, Earth and its processes tend towards the support of life and its diversification. Following the Earth’s example, a jacket maker ensures that its spaces and operations are increasingly supporting biodiversity. Then, they let everyone know! Whether on a website life-list or in annually shared species and green space report, they make sure that all involved are informed.</p>

    This way, all involved are aware of their role in furthering subsequent cycles.  This way, all those involved are aware of the ethos they are energizing.  This way, all involved are aware of the long-term plan that they are part of.  This way, creator and consumer are aware of the biodiversity they are vitalizing.

    <p>With Earth’s example setting the parameters for green, the path ahead to the green world for all that we all long to see, is clear. Dutifully our enterprises can let us all know their contributions — and proudly!</p>

    <p>A dress maker can proudly declare how its organic fabric is biodegradeable — and also the biodiversity it has supported that year. A sandal maker re-using rubber can proudly declare the amount of pollution its up-cycling prevents — and also its circular plan for the sandal’s soles. A swim-wear maker can proudly showcase its for-Earth business priority —along with its plan for the sequestration of its polyesters and its net-carbon subtraction for the year.</p>

    <p>Through ecological accounting and disclosure, the color of our enterprises, products and processes will scintillate like a tree’s first Spring buds — their fresh and vivid green a beacon to eyes weary of a long grey winter.</p>

    <p>With unprecedented confidence, we can make our choices sure of the color, character and the well-being vitalized. With our support, enterprises can steadily increase their give to vastly exceed their take — for their well being, ours and everyone’s.</p>

    <p>Just like the forest.</p>

    <p>A just like Earth.</p> -->

Another root was coated in a shimmering yellow mycorrhizal fungus, a Piloderma, and I followed the fleshy yellow threads to an old birch. I sat back, startled. This little seedling was entwined in a prosperous mycorrhizal network with both the mature Douglas fir and the paper birch.  The network did indeed seem to be sustaining the seedling. The old trees could be sending it sugars or amino acids through the fleshy fungal mats, to compensate for the minuscule rates of photosynthesis the tiny needles could muster in the dim light and the sips of nutrients the fledgling roots were pulling from the soil."
