        BENEATH THE MOSSY FLOOR of North American temperate forests, there lies a hidden network exchanging the needs, nutrients and character of trees. Observing the lush verdant splendor above, it is easy to overlook that the secret to the forest’s well-being lies below. Starting several centimeters under the soil, a multitude of mycorrhizal fungal species attach to the roots of Spruce, Birch, Douglas Fir and other trees and plants. From one root system to another, white mycellial threads spread tree to tree like an organic fiber-optic web. This ever adjusting symbiotic system assists its members to soak up water, nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients not just from the soil, but from each other.  As one tree’s abundance of a nutrient is sent to its roots for storage, it can be tapped through the network by its neighbors. As trees share nutrients, they also share valuable information. The rates a tree takes and gives tells the others about itself and its environment. A Spruce short on water lets the others know by its added draw. A Birch catching sun through a break in the canopy, informs the others with the extra sugars it shares. A Douglas fir attacked by insects alerts its neighbours by a sudden shift in its pattern of give and take. Often, these signals can result in forest wide adaptions — from the the release of defensive toxins to fend off an infestation, to the mobilization of new roots and the reconfiguration of connections. Affectionately known by scientists as the ‘wood wide web’, as a new sapling plugs in at the edge of the forest, the consciousness of the collective expands. Node by node, tree by tree, the mycorrhizal network spreads. So aware, come damage, drought, or whatever disaster, both tree and forest ever augment their capacity to respond, adapt and thrive.</i>

        AS WE ENDEAVOUR TO understand the parameters of ecological contribution we arrive at the fifth facet of Earth's cosmological character.  Thus far we have observed that Earthen process tend towards ecological enrichment through the sprial cycle of matter and energy towards ever increasing vitality and diversity.  Our fifth Earth ethic, encapsulates the entire dynamic, precipitating that phenonomenon which sets Earth apart from all its fellow planets in the solar system:  Consciousness.  More specifically: <i>an ever increasing awareness of one's connection to the cycles of life</i>.  This ecological awareness is particularily evident in cyclocentric cultures around the world.  As we shall see, as societies like the Igorots have centered their cultures around the cycles of life around them, their awareness of their place, their give and their ecolgical take has steadily deepended.  This cyclic integration provides an example for our keen green enterprises to follow and to summarize, periodically and publically, their management of energy and matter, to raise the awareness of all those touched by their processes.  In so doing, we can not only ensure that our enterprise are green, we can begin to steadily make them greener and greener.</p>

        <p>To begin, let us review one more time Earth's stellar story.</p>

        <p>In the Earth's slow and steady progress from barren to biosphere, we have observed thus far four seperate phenomena.  First, Earthen processes have tended their cycles into spirals of matter and energy than have systematically greened the planet.  Second, we observe that this greening process has entailed a tendency of energy spirally outwards to the benefit of the whole.  Third, we have observed that it has entailed the spiral of the principal elements of Earthen processes into greater and greater concentration.  Fourth, we have observed that the process by which these spirals of matter and energy intertwine, has entailed ever greater systemic diversity.  Finally, observing the relentless greening of the planet (with all its up and downs, extinctions and flourishings) we observe that the interlation of its organisms, ecosystems and biomes has tended towards each becoming ever more aware of its interalation with the other.</p>

        <p>This awareness takes many forms that transcend the customary human meaning of "awareness" and of "consciousness". It is the awareness of plankton.  Of a whale.  Of a dinausar.  Of a human of his or her surroundings.  Of a tree in the wood wide web.  It could even include the steadily expanding world wide web.</p>

        <p>While each of these forms of consciousness trade in various forms of information, the most important, in an ecological relationship, is of an entities give and and take, needs and nutrients.  The difference of a give and take, of a having and not, being a cyclical process, connected with the planet's own cycles of day and night, moon phase and season.</p>
        
       <p>As we see in the case of temperate mycorrhizal forest networks, the process of ecological enrichment is directly correlated to the awareness that rises between each node in the network to its place and participation in the whole. Here the correlation between ecological awareness and ecological enrichment. Not only do similar fungal connections underlie other forests around the world, throughout countless other ecosystems we can observe inter-species exchanges of information. Whether a flower’s scent signaling readiness to a pollinator or a berry’s color signaling ripeness to a forager, the needs of one species and the nutrients of another are constantly being exchanged. Indeed, it is this ongoing disclosure of give and take that makes an ecology an eco-system. In this way, mycorrizal root fungi have been shown to be key to the abundance of a forest — enabling saplings seeded with mycellium to grow two to three times faster than those without.</p>
    
      <p>As we strive to ensure our human enterprises are green, the Earth shows us the way forward. Just as the Earth tended its processes towards awareness, we are called to intend with our own. When our human processes result in the full disclosure of give, take and character, then the awareness of all involved is raised. Acts and enterprises that increase the collective ecological consciousness, fulfill the principle of awareness raising. These processes can then be considered to be an ecological contribution — and green.</p>

      <p>Here the example of the Igorots can inspire and guide us.</p>
