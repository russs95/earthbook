     <div class="lead-page-paragraph">
      OVER THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY, certain nations have excelled far more than others at the art of ecological integration.  While some societies steadily depleted the ecosystems of which they were part, these societies steadily enriched them, increasing their synchrony with the cycles of life around them.  As we strive to discern for ourselves what green should really mean, we have much to learn from them.  In particular the recognition of the way in which they themselves learned— their way of knowing the plants and animals around them as kin, elders and teachers.  
     </div>

    <div class="page-paragraph">

    <p>While great greening societies have thrived around the planet, there is no more dramatic an example than the nations that first inhabited the Americas.</p>

      <p id="32">Five hundred years ago, prior to the cataclysmic arrival of germs, animals and humans from Europe, the Americas were then home to hundreds of thriving, independent and prosperous nations.<a href="footnotes">³²</a>  Contemporary estimates of the population of the continents at the time range in the tens of millions to over one hundred million<a href="footnotes">³³</a> with many towns and cities ranging in size from tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand inhabitants.<a href="footnotes">³⁴</a></p>


      <p>Like all nations and cities, such concentrations of humanity had a significant impact on the ecosystems and continental biomes of which they were a part.</p>

      <p id="35-up">Having settled the continent over ten thousand years ago, these nations had long acquired sophisticated hunting, fishing and gathering technologies. Also common was the use of fire to effect huge swaths of land.  In all respects, these nations were more than capable of over-hunting, overfishing, over-gathering<a href="footnotes">³⁵</a> and depleting the carrying capacities of the ecosystems of which they depended.   </p>

      <p>However, over-consumption and exploitation did not occur.  Nor the depletion of the continent’s ecosystems.</p>

      <p>In fact, just the opposite.</p>

      <p>In 1492, as the first Europeans arrived on the shores of a very old ‘new world’ they were shocked not only by the vastly differing societies and cultures they encountered, but so too by the vastly different fauna and flora.</p>

      <p>And their abundance.</p>

      <p>From South America to North, explorers recorded dazzled accounts of the ecological vitality they observed: Rivers overflowing with fish; grasslands filled with countless grazing beasts; forests full of animals, birds, and trees of colossal size;  coastal shoals overflowing with marine life.</p>

      <p>Alas, the newcomers lacked the conceptual ability to truly see what they were seeing.   Seeped a culture, in which food largely came from single crops and domesticated animals, the explorers and the colonists to follow, mistook the abundant ecosystems they encountered to be the work of ‘nature’ alone:</p>
      
      <div class="quote"><p id="36">“…the country before us exhibited every thing that bounteous nature could be expected to draw into one point of view.  As we had no reason to imagine that this country had ever been indebted for any of its decorations to the hand of man, I could not possibly believe that any uncultivated country had ever been discovered exhibiting so rich a picture.”</p></div>

      <p style="text-align:right;font-size:1em; margin-top:-10px; margin-bottom:20px">— Captain Vancouver’s observations of the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1792<a href="footnotes">³⁶</a></p>
      

     <p>Today, we know now that this inference was gravely mistaken.  Modern research has confirmed what the descendants of these nations have known all along.  The thriving ecosystems of the time were not the result of a lack of human participation, but rather the consequence of it.   </p>

     <p id="37">Where these nations foraged, forests are today demonstrably more abundant and biodiverse than adjacent un-managed ecosystems<a href="footnotes">³⁷</a>.  Where nations fished, the rivers are today more abundant than others<a href="footnotes">³⁸</a>.  Where they sourced their shellfish and clams, the shoals today host more species than adjacent un-cultivated, or ‘natural’, ecosystems<a href="footnotes">³⁹</a>.  The very manner that these societies interacted with an ecosystem was instrumental to its exceptional flourishing.  Even the Amazon rain-forest, long seen as the paragon of wild ‘bounteous nature’, has been revealed to have been the site of pre-Columbian agriculture, gardens, towns and cities.<a href="footnotes">⁴⁰</a></p>

     <p id="40">Significantly, the various cultural structures by which these nations came to integrate with their ecosystems were just as diverse as the ecosystems themselves.  Agriculture, languages and political systems varied tremendously up and down the continent.  While some were patriarchal, others were matriarchal.  While some were kingdoms, others were confederacies.  While some sought peace, others sought war.</p>

     <p id="41">However, despite the wide diversity in culture and politics, beneath it all lay a relatively consistent foundational view of themselves and the world— especially as compared to that of the arriving Europeans.<a href="footnotes">⁴¹</a> In much the same way that the disparate nations of Europe shared a continental and cultural provenance, so too did the nations of the Americas.<a href="footnotes">⁴²</a> Consequently, just as the ideas of ancient Greece and Rome gave nations as disparate as England and Russia, Finland and France, a shared underlying view of ‘man and nature’, so too did the first nations of the Americas have their own view in which all creatures were seen as kin.</p>

     <p id="43">Across the Americas, nations, clans and tribes shared an underlying metaphysics in which humans, animals and plants were understood as members of a common family.  For these nations all organisms were equally integral parts of the living land— <i>a community of kindred beings sharing ancestry and origins</i>.<a href="footnotes">⁴³</a></p>

     <p id="44">From this 'kincentric' world view, animals and plants were respected as kindred relations: elder brothers or sisters, grandmothers or grandfathers.<a href="footnotes">⁴⁴</a>  Then, just as one learns from a distinguished elder, these cultures paid special attention to those particularly distinguished organisms around them. Creatures that in elegance, ingenuity and beauty had magnificently mastered their ecological integration.</p>

     <p>From a scientific perspective, we can today appreciate the depth of their world view.</p>

     <p>Just as brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles are parts of a family because of their shared ancestry, so too are plants, insects, animals, and humans parts of an ecological family connected by lineages that reach far back into time.  Just as a son, parent and grandparent are subsets of a family system so too are humans, plants and animals all subsets systems of the ecosystems of which they are part. And just as younger and elder family members differ in their accumulation of wisdom and mastery, so too do members of an ecosystem vary in the adaption and integration to it.  From this kincentric view, plants and animals, having had millions of years longer than humans to integrate into a particular ecosystem have invaluable systemic adaptations for humans to learn from.</p>

     <p>Indeed, a salmon and an eagle, an oyster and a pine tree, all embody the culmination of hundreds of millions of years of behavioral and evolutionary trial and error— the result of innumerable interactions, adaptations and optimizations to integrate within a particular environment. In comparison, the first humans to settle in the Americas (only a few tens of thousands of years ago!) were newcomers— ecological younglings who had much to learn from their resident elders.</p>

     <p>And so they did.</p>

     <p>As early Americans observed the way in which the lives of plants and animals synced with the cycles of an ecosystem, tendencies were noted, characters discerned and virtuosity honored.  From the cooperation of crows to the diligence of a deer, from the strength of a bear to the endurance of an elk, stories about particular creature and the virtue that it most illuminated, were passed down over the generations.</p>

     <p id="45">Often, a tribe, resonating with the character of a particular creature would adopt it as their representative and guide. Almost all North American first nations contained clans that took an animal as their totem.<a href="footnotes">⁴⁵</a> Through stories and myths, they were inspired by the animal's ecological example to lay out their clan’s principal values and ethics.</p>

     <p id="46">So grounded in values and virtues, kincentric societies were able to weave ecological mastery into the fabric of their language, grammar and values.<a href="footnotes">⁴⁶</a> In so doing they were able to by-pass the tedious, million-year process of evolutionary trial and error and dramatically fast forward their ecological awareness, integration and the collective well-being of themselves and their kindred relations.  In this way their cultures came to sync with the cycles of the creatures they admired most— the migration of geese, the return of salmon, the coming and going of whales and elk.</p>

     <p>And precisely because these life-cycles continued to thrive, so could they continue to learn from them.  </p>

     <p>In a spiral of ever deeper knowing, awareness and consciousness, kincentric cultures steadily enhanced the harmony of the ecosystems of which they were part. With the momentum of millennia of compounding insights, their way of knowing steadily led to an ecological understanding of unparalleled lucidity.  Steadily, these societies were able to effectively co-create with plants and animals a common home for all to thrive.</p>

     <p>Today, in realizing the great green feats of these nations, in turn we can learn from them and follow their example.  </p>

     <p>To do so, the recognition of the power and potential of kincentric knowing is key. </p>

     <p>Only then can we realize its absence in our modern way of seeing the world.</p>

     <p>And only then can we understand that this hole in our modern worldview is the result of a deep metaphysical mistake: an ancient error that has for too long destined all our endeavours and enterprises to deplete and degrade.</p>

        <div class="footnote-text">This biological encounter, after hundreds of thousands of years of continental ecological separation, was to have a seismic impact on the biomes and civilizations of the Americas.  Diseases spread like wildfire ahead of European explorers killing 90-95% of human populations.  Only several years later, explorers encountering the decimated villages and cities made gravely inaccurate assumptions about the sparse human habitation they observed.  Their estimations of human population and ecological consequence were thus woefully low.   Population estimates weren’t rectified until centuries later by anthropologists such as Henry Dobyns.</div>
