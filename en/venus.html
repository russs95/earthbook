Earth's orbit has a radius of 1 AU and distances in the solar system were measured in terms of this unit, even though it wasn't understood how big that distance was in terms of other units (like miles). The Earth-Venus distance is given in the simulation in terms of AU. <span class="question">What is the radius of Venus' circular orbit?</span></p>

                    <p><img src="images/elongation.jpg" border="2" align="right"/>Planetary positions can be described in terms of an angle called <em>elongation</em>. This is the angular separation between the sun and the planet as seen from Earth. So point toward a planet with one arm and toward the sun with the other arm &mdash; the angle between your arms is elongation. In the simple model of Copernicus &mdash; planets in circular orbits in the same plane &mdash; it allows a planet's position to be specified with a single coordinate. </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Astronomers are also very interested in angular diameter &mdash; a measure of how big an object appears in the sky to an observer. Astronomers measured the angular diameter of planets in telescopes to determine the distance to planets (long before the invention of radar which made the technique unnecessary). <span class="action">Drag venus around noting the values of its angular diameter.</span> Then answer each of the folowing questions related to angular diameter:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li class="question">What is the ratio &mdash; the maximum angular diameter divided by the minimum angular diameter? </li>
                        <li class="question">How are distance and angular diameter correlated?  When distance is large is angular diameter large or small? (scrutinize your conclusion &mdash; does this make sense?) Do you think that angular diameter is proportional to distance or inversely proportional to distance?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the early 1600s there was considerable debate regarding the layout of the solar system. Measuring the angular diameter of a planet allowed one to infer a planet's distance.</p>
