    In sunny ocean shallows, coral polyps, tiny marine invertebrates, build their home.  Working with even tinier sun-powered plankton that live within them, the duo capture carbon and calcium out of the waters around them.  Living in colonies of tens of thousands individuals, each polyp uses the nutrients that it collects to secrete a calcium carbonate exoskeleton around itself.  As one polyp dies and another takes its place, each generation builds upon the legacy of the last.  Steadily, skeleton by skeleton, millimeter by millimeter, their home-upon-homes fratally unfolds. Patterns begin to emerge.  Domes, shelves, horns, fans and a myriad of varying geometries blossom. The vast surface areas of these carbonate palaces provides a three dimensional neighbourhood of niches, shelters and microhabitats.  As many species of fish, invertebrates, and microorganisms make their home within the space, their lives intertwine. Complex and interconnected relationships emerge. This web of dependencies vitalizes the co-evolution of diverse strategies and adaptions to exploit or evade. Cycle by cycle, as the tiny polyps and their colonies flourish, so too does the vitality, resiliency and diversity of the ecosystem of which they are a part.

      The process by which the coral polyp builds its home, and in so doing supports a common home for a great diversification of others, is an example to inspire and guide our modern green aspirations.  Indeed, the polyp's process of spiraling its matter into sequestration and distributing energy out to its ecosystem, perfectly embodies our last two Earthen ethics.  However, while in our last two chapters we looked individually at Earth's dynamics of energy and of matter, in practice, neither acts on its own.  And when an organism's spirals of matter and energy are both in Earthen resonance, a fourth Earthen tendency emerges.   As we shall see, the way in which the coral polyp's vitalizes the systemic diversity of its space is a microcosm the very process by which Earth transformed from barren to biosphere.  In this parralel, our fourth Earthen ethic becomes clear.  As we shall also see, in the same way that cyclocentric cultures have long embodied this ethic to enrich the ecosystems of which they are part, so too can our modern acts and enterprises.</p>

 <div class="page-paragraph">

      <!-- <p id="en-2-4-0b">By looking closely at the way both accumulated matter to increase their hospitable space and by which these spaces vitalized a web of inter-dependencies, our fourth Earthen ethic becomes clear.  By noting the way in which scientists have measured this transition, the parameters of the principle shall also become clear.  By observing the way in which the Igorots and Wet'suweten  have embodied this principle to enrich their ecosystems, we can then be inspired to do the same.  Finally, with the help of the fourth Earthen ethic we can make sense of modern attempts to green spaces.  Most importantly however, we gain the guidance to ensure that our for-Earth enterprises are truly are green.</p> -->
      </div>

   
      <p id="en-2-4-01">To begin, let us return again to Earth's primordial beginnings for a closer look.  However, this time, let us not just observe the way that life unfolded, but also the way in which our scientists have themselves observed and measured its unfolding. </p>

      <p id="en-2-4-02">As we saw in Earth's stellar story, over the course of the last four billion years, the cosmological character of our planet has unfurled from barren to biosphere.  Despite cataclysms and extinctions a singular upward tendency prevailed.  The variety of organisms and ecosystems on the planet's surface has steadily increased.<p>

        <p id="en-2-4-03">Nowhere in the fossil record is the process of diversification more evident than in the oceans.</p>

        <p id="en-2-4-04">In 1998, paleontologist Joseph Sepkoski completed a comprehensive database of marine life over the last 541 million years. Focusing exclusively on life that flourished within ocean spaces, he compiled over 30,000 fossil genera, representing the finds and categorization of millions of species by centuries of fossil hunters. By recording each genus’s appearance and disappearance in the fossil timeline, he was able to chart for how long each were active and when they died off.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Mass Extinctions in the Marine Fossil Record, By DAVID M. RAUP, J. JOHN SEPKOSKI JR., Science19 Mar 1982 : 1501–1503">⁷⁷</a></p>
        
        <p id="en-2-4-05">Sepkoski was particularly interested in showing Earth’s great rises and falls in diversity — such as the explosion of life in the Carboniferous to the rise and fall of the dinosaurs. Indeed, his timeline of extinctions correlates directly with the dating of great meteors and volcanoes by geologists. However, just as important as showing periodic declines and increases in diversity, his graph shows something even ore fundamental: an inexorable increase in the diversity of the marine biome over Earth's history.</i>(See figure 1)</p>


    <p id="en-2-4-06">It is important to view this tendency within the context of our last two Earthen ethics.</p>
    
    <p id="en-2-4-06b">In our last two chapters, we observed  Earth's spiral of matter tends towards concentration, and Earth's spiral of energy tends towards the benefit of the whole.  These two tendencies formed our second and third Earthen ethics-- dynamics fundamental to the enrichment of Earth's biosphere.</p>
    
    <p id="en-2-4-06c">Yet as a cycle's matter and energy swirled, each affected the other and their spirals are inherently intertwined.  As Earthen matter accrued into organic systems of ever greater complexity, energy could be better captured.  As more energy was captured, organisms dispersed it ever more extensively across the surface of the planet.</p>
    
    <!-- better transition! -->

    <p id="en-2-4-07">Here let us return to the coral polyp.  The tendency of this tiny creature's life cycles are in many ways a microcosm of the very process that has shaped Earth's diverse and vital biosphere over billions of years. </p>

    <!-- This dual process, The underlying mechanism by which this biodiversity unfurled on Earth are parraled by the example of the coral polyp. the process of making space to support others, which is exemplified by the coral polyp, is a microcosm of the broader process that has shaped Earth's diverse and vital biosphere over billions of years. 
      The emergence of photosynthetic cyanobacteria, for instance, began to transform Earth's atmosphere by releasing oxygen, making it more habitable for other life forms.-->
        
        <p id="en-2-4-07">Just as Earth's unfolding has resulted in a hospitable space for more and more organisms, so too does the life process of the polyp lead to a common home for more and more creatures.    Over billions of years, the contributions of various organisms, from plants to animals, fungi, and microorganisms, have collectively shaped the planet's ecosystems so that other organisms could find a home and flourish themselves. Over thousands of life cycles, the coral building process of the polyp leads to reefs that host a vast array of adapted species, each contributing in their own way to the common home of all.</p>

        <p id="en-2-4-08">Secondly, just as the success of coral reefs is dependent on mutualistic relationships between corals and the symbiotic algae that provide them with energy, Earth's biosphere has thrived due to the intricate web of life forms that support and depend on each other.  In a broader sense, Earth's transformation has relied on intricate ecological relationships. The co-evolution of species and their interactions, such as pollination, seed dispersal, predation, and competition, has led to the development of complex and mutually beneficial despersions of nutrients. These ecological relationships have allowed various species to occupy specific niches and adapt to changing environmental conditions, ensuring the planet's long-term biodiversity and ecological stability.  This interdependence ensures the sustainability and resilience of ecosystems, as well as the continued evolution of life on the planet.</p>
        
        <p id="en-2-4-09">The gradual accumulation of species, the development of mutualistic relationships, and the complexity of ecological interactions have all played a crucial role in Earth's transformation from a barren to biosphere.</p>

        <!-- world to a green to a thriving biosphere hosting more and more species -->

<!--     
    <p id="en-2-4-00">The unfolding of the first simple organic origins had everything to do with the emergent conditions of planet Earth-- as compared to the surface of Venus or Mars.  However, as these first organic systems unfolded on the two dimensional surface of the planet, their ability to unfold increased as their bodies, shells and skeletons crated additional space within this space.  Consequently, within a two dimension sufarface space, the net density of life continued to grow.  This had as much to do with the planet as the life that provided the conditions for the next unfolding.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">From ancient carboniferous forests that sheltered the emergent dinausaurs, to coral reefs that sheltered and supported the diversifitication of the oceans, as Earthen ecosystems and biomes have become more abundant, vital and resilient, they have done so through the same inexorable process of diversification.  Indeed, this phenomen can be observed in organisms themselves!  From mamals to coral polyps within our digestive systems are a whole of host of flourishing microbiomes that reflect the support of diversity on the outside.</p> -->

    <p id="en-2-4-12">Today, as we strive to make our human enterprises green, both Earth and the coral polyp provide an example for us to follow.</p>

    <!-- The correlation between the greening of the biosphere and the rise in planetary biodiversity, presents us with a fifth principle of ecological contribution. Like our other principles, it is a phenomenon that we observe from the micro to the macro. In everything from cellular life to continental biomes, by tending its processes towards diversification, the Earth cultivated systems with an ever wider variety of participants. -->

    <p id="en-2-4-13">Just as Earth’s processes tended towards diversification within its space, so too must we intend and achieve with our own processes. Only when the intention and the result of our enterprise is the support and vitalization of diversity in our spaces is the principle of diversification met. Only then can our acts and enterprises be considered ecological contributions — and green.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-14">With the Earthen of diversification ethic in hand, we have a fourth criteria to evaluate and guide our attempts at green:  <i>Are the spaces of our enterprises supporting and vitalizing the diversification of species?</i> </p>

    <p id="en-2-4-15">Even if the other four Earthen ethics are met, only if a process is supporting and vitalizing a diversity of species in its space can it be considered an ecological contribution.</p> -->

    <!-- <p id="en-2-4-16"></p>>To see how this Earthen ethic works, let us consider one of the most common modern endeavours for greening space: tree planting.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-17"> Often, organizations and individuals will attempt to green a space by planting tree seedling on a barren field. Indeed, by adding one new species to the space (the tree), the biodiversity has increased by one.  This is an important step in the green direction.  However, if the trees are planted in such a way (a dense grid for example) in which other species are not welcome, and after a period of time the increase of species involvement hasn't not further increased, then, the principle of diversity is not met.</p>
      
    <p id="en-2-4-18"></p>>All too often this is the case when the intention of the plantation is not a kincentric support of biodiversity, but rather a humancentric goal of creating a park or of harvesting timber.</p> -->
<!-- 
    <p id="en-2-4-19">To acheive the fourth Earthen ethic, our green enterprises must therefore first and foremost declare their for-Earth intention.  Second they must account for the amount of carbon released vs concentrated by the enterprise.  And third, they must also account for their space and their support for biodiversity.</p> -->

    <p id="en-2-4-19">To acheive the fourth Earthen ethic, our green enterprises must therefore account for their space and the species they host.</p>
    
    <p id="en-2-4-20">Here we can learn much from the labour and insights of our scientists.</p>
    
    <p id="en-2-4-20b">In his undertaking to understand ancient marine diversity, Sepkoski reviewed thousands of scientific journals by paleontologists and biologists to survey the number of species at the outset of an age and at its end. Only by surveying, naming and listing the species within over a certain period of time and in a certain space, could he demonstrate the process of diversification.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-21">Consequently, our own processes, to be green must likewise demonstrate through naming, listing and accounting, that they are supportive of diversity.  In particular, the physical space and time that holds a process or enterprise.  By accounting for the net space used by our enterprises (<i>S</i> in cubic meters) and their gradual increase in the net amount of species supported (<i>N</i>number of species) over a period of time (<i>Y</i> years) can we know whether our process, projects and enterprises are in fact supporting biodiversity.</p>
    
    <p id="en-2-4-22">Such a process of accounting, fundamentally involves the naming and knowing the species within our spaces.  The naming and knowing of contributors — or not — expresses the depth of a process’s intention to supporting life — or lack of it.  And the gradual accumulation of names, demonstrates tangibly the steady welcoming, support and vitalization of biodiversity within our spaces.</p>

    <p>Cyclocentric cultures once again show us the way forward and the green heights that are possible.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-11">As we saw in our first two Earthen ethics, the Igorots and the Wetsuweten, had cultural values that systematically encouraged integration with the cycles of life of which they were part.  In the case of the Igorots, this meant that farmers who integrated a great number of plants and animals into their gardens were esteemed more than others.  This was done by systematically terracing hillsides in a way that created more space for all.  Likewise, the Wetsuweten took great care to hunt, fish and harvest in ways that regenerated the animal, river and forest ecosystems with which they interacted.  Over the 12,000 years that they presided over the coastal interior of the Pacific Northwest, their ancestors assisted as a barren, post-gacial landscape transformed into a thriving, vital and diverse ecosystem.</p>

    

    <p id="en-2-4-23">In this way, we can intentionally follow the path of Earth, the Igorots, the Wet'suweten and the Coral Polyp in tending an ever increasing diversity and vitality of life within our shared spaces.</p>

    
<!-- 
    <p id="en-2-4-00">However, it is important to note that this third Earthen ethic need not be be the result of physical effort or the energetic restructuring that we see in our first three ethics.  As Earth's inexorably multi-billion year process shows us, diversification is geometric consequence of Earth's double spiral of matter and energy tendencies.  Thus, by meeting the first three Earthen ethics, our door has been opened to the support of our fellow species.  The full force of the Earth’s tendency towards diversity can then express itself and re-vitalize our spaces!</p> -->
    
    <p id="en-2-4-24">As our life-lists grow, something especially Earthen unfolds:  We become aware that there were far more organisms sharing our space than we ever imagined — species small and mighty enriching the soil and cleaning the air. As we discover animals and insects, plants and fungi that have long been our unnamed fellows, their addition become a legitimate boon for our life-lists ratios— and an indication of a phenomenon even more profound unfolding.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-25">For as our garden green spaces transform to forests, and as our forests transform to wild and wondrous sanctums, so too is the consciousness of our connection to it all blossoming like a spring flower. As we will see in our next Earthen Ethic, just as important as diversification is our awareness of our place in the process itself.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-26">Our fifth and final Earthen ethic.</p>

<!--

  <p id="en-2-4-00">Sepkoski's famous graph helps to lay out . The correlation between the greening of the biosphere and the rise in planetary biodiversity, presents us with a fifth principle of ecological contribution. Like our other principles, it is a phenomenon that we observe from the micro to the macro. In everything from cellular life to continental biomes, by tending its processes towards diversification, the Earth cultivated systems with an ever wider variety of participants. Soon, organisms and ecolosystems were making overlapping contributions, spiraling matter into ever more concentrated configurations and spiraling nutrients upwards to the benefit of all. </p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">In so doing, the tension between their distribution of energy and their concentration of matter, unfurls through space and time.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">Like those cycles of the Igorot, Salmon, Ammonite and the Earth.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">In sharp contrast to the desolation that unfolded on the surfaces our fellow planets, the geometry of this Earthen double spiral has led to just the opposite: </p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">A never ending spin towards ever more vibrant and diverse systems.</p>

    
    <!--It’s a little like the last time you found yourselves gathering with a group of strangers — perhaps for a party, a team or a meetup around a common intention.
    
    After all, how can we work together if we don’t know the names and needs of our fellows? How can we assist each the other if we don’t know our respective preferences, skills and strengths?
    
    Unlike the previous principle of net-subtraction, achieving the Earth’s way of diversification is simpler. No outset investments are needed to reduce grey impacts or enhance green ones. Putting out the welcome mat requires only courage.
    
    Whereas achieving net-zero carbon and beyond is the result of a process, diversification is a property of the process. As such it is fundamentally relative. A rain-forest preserve, though it may host thousands of species, may fail the principle of diversification if it’s space (and thus the number of species it hosts) is reduced by government or industry. Meanwhile, a mono-crop farm that has for decades been restricting its space, can — with a courageous change of heart — on-ramp overnight onto the road of diversification.
    
    Embodying the principle of diversity begins with the slightest pivot. By shifting our spaces from restricting to welcoming, the most desolate landscrapes of our petro-capital age are put on a road towards hosting the most dramatic regenerations.
    
    For our planet, it’s never been about the number of species. Rather the ongoing effort to provide them a home. Following the Earth’s example, step by step, our human-only spaces can become common homes.  -->


    <!--
    <p id="en-2-4-00">First, we assess. We observe in square meters just how much of our space has been restricted to humans and how much need not be any longer. We then take stock of what creatures are already with us — a list, a database, a registry ready to be ever expanded.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">Second, we welcome. Slowly and steadily, our ratio of closed to open space can be increased. While the first tiny steps may seem trivial — planting a tree, adding some potted plants, building a bird feeder — what is key is our direction.</p>

    <p id="en-2-4-00">Third, we allow, guide and harvest. With our fellow participants accounted for and honored their efforts will be coupled with ours towards everyone’s benefit. Mindfully, we give our attention, gratitude and assistance. By allowing them to pursue their parameters of purpose, and by harvesting in a way that enriches everyone else, diversification will further manifest. In the branches of our first tree, birds will roost, the fruits enjoyed by us and all, and the seeds of the next trees will spread.</p>

Fourth, we compensate. As more and more species join our space we will still need our human only spaces. For those closed spaces we must make, we expand an equivalent open one. A new cement foundation or paved parking can be matched with an equal green space. In this way, we can be sure to continue increasing our ratio of open: closed space and maintain our overall welcome. Little by little, to make up for our grey-spaces we can let our lawns go to gardens, replace fences with hedges, our old factories with fields.

And finally… we discover!

With our door wide open, the full force of the Earth’s tendency towards diversity can express itself and re-vitalize our spaces. As our life-lists focus our attention to our ecological community, we will find that there were far more creatures at work with us than we ever imagined — species small and mighty enriching the soil and cleaning the air. As we discover creatures that have long been our unnamed friends, their addition become a legitimate boon for our life-lists ratios— and an indication of a phenomenon even more profound unfolding.

As our garden green spaces transform to forests, and as our forests transform to wild and wondrous sanctums, so too is the consciousness of our connection to it all blossoming like a spring flower. As we will see in our next Earthen Ethic, just as important as diversification is our awareness of our place in the process itself.
