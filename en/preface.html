<div class="lead-page-paragraph">

  In 2011, the amount of dirty diapers, sandals, bags and wrappers entering the Chico River had reached a breaking point.  Downriver, overwhelmed by the ever arriving flow of plastic, the the Filipino province of Kalinga took action to sue the upriver town of Bontoc.  The mayor took the charges seriously.  He set about shutting down the various legal and illegal dumpsites a long the river's shore.
</div>


<div class="page-paragraph">
     
    <p>But where was all our plastic to go?</p>

    <p>For those of us living along the river, the challenge was palpable.</p>
      
    <p>For centuries the tribes of the region, collectively known as the Igorots, had thrived in fierce independence from the rest of the Filipino archipelago.  However, over the last decade, the flow of modern of modern goods had made its way into even the most remote villages.  Whereas before, the woven leaves and reeds that had long served as packaging and containers were entirely biodegradable, now strange modern materials refused to degrade when discarded.</p>

    <p>However, the Igorots had not been sitting idly by.  In their culture, the art of repurposing is highly esteemed.  Consequently, the region had become a hot-bed of up-cycling innovations.  In town old tires were being cut up to make remarkably functional chairs and tables.  In the mines plastic dynamite cable was being woven to make traditional backpacks.  In the villages straws and wrappers were being used to weave mats, purses, wallets and containers of all kinds. </p>

   <p>It was a movement that both myself and Banayan were both fascinated by and engaged with.   Whereas Banayan had been working on environmental education, I was involved in improving designs to make saleable products.  However, in the face of the ever-growing flow of discarded plastic, our success was extremely limited.  As the legal stand-off in Bontoc intensified, we realized that securing plastic out of the environment was far more vital than making handicrafts.
    
    <p>Fortuitously, my colleagues and I in the village of Sabangan had been experimenting with another innovation: a technique from South America in which PET bottles were packed full of sand to make building blocks.  It just so happened that the river sand pit and the local dump-site were side by side.  My friends and I decided to try packing our bottles full of plastic instead of sand.</p>

   <p>The experiment was a success!  Not only were we able to make “bottle bricks” that were just as effective as those packed with sand, it seemed like we’d been able to secure a great deal of plastic that would have otherwise scattered into the river.</p>

   <p>At my home, I began to experiment with packing my own plastic into a bottle.  I made a small garden with it.  Everyone was delighted.  The nearby school, which also was struggling to dispose the plastic of hundreds of students, asked me to show how it was done.  After a day of packing plastic, making bricks and building a compost, I and the community were excited to this alternative to burning and dumping plastic in the river.</p>
  
   <p>As, the technique began to spread to other schools, Banayan stepped in.  She realized the potential for raising the awareness around the ecological issues.  We worked together to create a guide book and a reporting system.  Through her coordination what was soon to become called ‘ecobricking’, spread out to hundreds of schools in the province.</p>

   <p>Then to thousands.</p>

   <p>With a year, as the entire Northern Philippines department of education, the Catholic and Protestant Churches, and various municipal and provincial governments came on board, ecobricking fast became an alternative for millions of Filipinos.</p>

   <p>Having played a key role in the genesis of the movement, Banayan and I have watched with both joy and trepidation as it has spread.</p>

   <p>While it at first seemed a great victory that so much plastic was being contained and secured from contaminating the river, the matter was far from settled.  As Banayan and I would learn, plastic, is a multi-faceted phenomenon that, much as we wish, does not disappear after we dispose of it.  Nor, for that matter, when we put it in a bottle.</p>

   <p>As the movement spread by word of mouth, we observed that often, by providing a solution for plastic, the continued consumption of plastic was legitimized.</p>

   <p>In some schools we observed a jump in the consumption of soft-drinks so that there would be bottles to make ecobricks, and junk food to pack them.<p>

  <p>In other locations, we observed troubling applications of ecobricks.</p>

  <p>Some local government put their ecobricks to use in gardens in which they were fully exposed to the sun.  After several years, the bottles had disintegrated and all the plastic inside had scattered.  In other cases, ecobricks were put to use with cement in constructions that, once they came to an end, would crumble and inevitably rupture the soft plastic of the ecobricks bottle.</p>

    <p>Banayan and I, observing these phenomena in our local communities as well as in the global ecobrick movement at large, were troubled.  Was our movement truly being of ecological service?  Or was it simply delaying an inevitable problem?  Worse, was it in fact accelerating the consumption of plastic?</p>
      
    <p>Over the last decade these questions have compelled us re-examine not only the 'solution' that we put out into the world, but so too the very definition of what constitutes an ecological 'solution' in the first place.</p>

    <p>In other words: what in fact should green really mean?</p>

    <p>Observing the shortcomings of ecobricking and other modern attempts at green, our suspicion has grown that that solving plastic has little to do with a particular technology.  Rather, we've come to see it has everything to do with upgrading our view of the world, discarding old errors and adjusting our enterprises accordingly .</p>
      
    <p>No matter what we do, far more crucial is how we do it.</p>

    <p>And in this, we have much to learn from the Igorots.</p>
