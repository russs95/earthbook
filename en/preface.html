<div class="lead-page-paragraph">

  In 2011, the amount of dirty diapers, sandals, bags and wrappers entering the Chico River had reached a breaking point.  Downriver, overwhelmed by the ever arriving flow of plastic, the various municipalities of the Filipino province of Kalinga took action to sue the upriver town of Bontoc.  The mayor took the charges seriously.  He set about shutting down the various legal and illegal dumpsites a long the river's shore.
</div>


<div class="page-paragraph">
     
    <p>But where was all our plastic to go?</p>

    <p>For those of us living along the river, the challenge was palpable.</p>
      
    <p>For centuries the tribes of the region, collectively known as the Igorots, had thrived in fierce and independence from the rest of the Filipino archipelago.  However, over the last decades, the flow of modern of modern goods had made its way into even the most remote villages.  Whereas before, the leaves and weaving that covered food and bodies were entirely biodegradable, now strange modern materials refused to degrade when discarded.</p>

    <p>However, the Igorots had not sat idly by.  In Igorot culture, the art of repurposing is esteemed above all.  For the last decade up-cycling innovations of all sorts had emerged to deal with the various materials.  In the mines plastic dynamic cable was being used instead of rattan to weave bags.  Plastic straws were being used to weave mats.  Silver wrappers were being used to make purses, wallets and containers of all kinds. </p>

   <p>It was a movement that both myself and Banayan were fascinated by and involved in.   Whereas Banayan had been working on eduction platforms, I had been working on upcycled innovations.  However, in the face of the seemingly unstoppable flow of discarded plastic,  both of us had met with limited success.</p>

   <p>As the legal stand-off in Bontoc intensified, we realized that securing plastic out of the environment was far more vital than making  handicrafts.
    
    <p>Fortuitously my colleagues and I in the village of Sabangan had recently been experimenting with another innovation: a technique from South America in which PET bottles were packed full of sand to make building blocks.  It just so happened that the river sand pit and the local dump site were side by side.  My friends and I decided to try packing our bottles full of plastic instead of sand.</p>

   <p>The experiment was a success!  Not only were we able to make “bottle bricks” that were just as effective as those packed with sand, it seemed like we’d been able to secure a great deal of plastic that would have otherwise scattered into the river.</p>

   <p>At my home, I began to experiment with packing my own plastic into a bottle.  I made a small garden with it.  Everyone was delighted.  The nearby school, which also was struggling to dispose the plastic of hundreds of students, asked me to show how it was done.  After a day of packing plastic, making bricks and building a compost, I and the community were excited to this alternative to burning and dumping plastic in the river.</p>
  
   <p>As, the technique began to spread to other schools, Banayan stepped in.  She realized the potential for raising the awareness around the ecological issues.  We worked together to create a guide book and a reporting system.  Through her coordination what was soon to become called ‘ecobricking’, spread out to hundreds of schools in the province.</p>

   <p>Then to thousands.</p>

   <p>With a year, as the entire northern board of education, schools, governments and churches came on board, ecobricking was fast becoming an alternative for millions of Filipinos.</p>

   <p>Having played a key role in the genesis of the movement, Banayan and I have watched with both joy and trepidation as it has spread.</p>

   <p>While it at first seemed to be a great victory that plastic once irrevocably destined to contaminate the Chico river was contained and secured, the matter was far from settled.  As Banayan and I were soon to learn, plastic, is a multi-faceted phenomenon that, much as we wish, does not disappear after we dispose of it.  Nor, for that matter, put it in a bottle.</p>

   <p>As the movement spread by word of mouth, we observed that often, by providing a solution for plastic, the continued consumption of plastic was legitimized.</p>

   <p>In some schools we observed a jump in the consumption of soft-drinks so that there would be bottles to make ecobricks, and junk food to pack them.<p>

  <p>In other locations, we observed naive and counter-productive applications of ecobricks.</p>

  <p>Some local government put their ecobricks to use in gardens in which they were fully exposed to the sun.  After several years, the bottles had disintegrated and all the plastic inside had scattered.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, other projects seemed to encourage the type of industrial construction that we were hoping to avoid.  Often ecobricks were put to use with cement in constructions that, once they came to an end, would crumble and inevitably rupture the soft plastic of the ecobricks bottle.</p>

    <p>In other cases, as ecobricks began to be put to use furniture, gardens and other structures, often these projects would involve large amounts of new materials.</p>


    <p>As Banayan and I have observed these phenomena in our local communities as well as in the global ecobrick movement at large, we’ve been compelled to re-examine not only our work, but our very definition of what constitutes a “green solution”.</p>
    
    <p>After all, how can something be green, if it in effect perpetuates and exacerbates the very pollution it aims to resolve?</p>

    <p>Observing the shortcomings of ecobricking (and other plastic management methods), our suspicion that solving plastic has little to do with a particular technology, and everything to do with advancing our view of the world, has grown to a certainly.</p>

    <p>Over the last decade, observing both ecobricks and other plastic management technologies, it has become abundantly clear to us that no matter what we do, far more crucial is how we do it.  Especially when it comes to the ecological dimension of processes, cycles and systems.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, we have good, and very green, examples to follow.</p>





    <!--
    <p>The result of a decade of dialogue and field work, the <i>Tractatus Ayyew</i> represents our culminating conviction of the critical relevance of indigenous wisdom to not just plastic plastic, but all our modern ecological challenges.</p>

    <p>In Latin, the word <i>tractatus</i> refers to the philosophical tradition of a treatise— a systematic exposition of a particular concept.  In Kan’kan’ue, the word <i>ayyew</i> refers to the virtue of cyclic ecological integration that guides the culture of the Igorot people. </p>

    <p>It is this ayyew ethos, and our experience of it, which inspires the theory of green and grey presented in the Tractatus Ayyew—   what we call an Earthen ethics.</p>

    <p>In the chapters ahead, we lay out our theory in three books.</p>

    <p>To begin, we provide a short sentence, a long sentence and a paragraph summary of Earthen Ethics. </p>

    <p>In Book One we clear the ground and establish the foundation of our Earth based ethics.</p>

    <p>In Book Two we dedicate a chapter to each of the five Earthen ethics. </p>

    <p>In Book Three we conclude with our five-fold solution for the management of plastic that can be applied to other green-aspiring enterprises.  </p>

    <p>In this way, the Tractatus Ayyew truly aims to be more a tool kit than a manifesto.  </p>

    <p>While the Tractatus progresses sequentially, each chapter is written as a standalone essay that represents one facet Earthen ethics.  This way, each chapter’s argument may be readily referenced to address particular fallacies, issues and arguments.   To represent this modular conceptual geometry, each chapter’s first page begins with a mandalic representation of its place within the whole.</p>

    <p>To begin, let's start with a quick sketch of where we are headed.</p>
