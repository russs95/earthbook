<div class="lead-page-paragraph">
  ALAS, not all books have beautiful beginnings.  
</div>


<div class="page-paragraph">
   <p>In 2011, the amount of dirty diapers, sandals, bags and wrappers entering the Chico River had reached a breaking point. Overwhelmed by the ever arriving slew of plastic, the downriver Filipino province of Kalinga took action to sue the upriver town of Bontoc. The mayor took the charges seriously. He set about shutting down the numerous dumpsites along the river's winding course through the remote region.</div>
     
    <p>But where was all our plastic to go?</p>

    <p>For those of us living along the river, the challenge was palpable.</p>
      
    <p>For centuries the tribes of the region, collectively known as the Igorots, had thrived in fierce independence from the rest of the Filipino archipelago. Insulated by a rugged, chain of verdant mountains, the Igorots had remained largely insulated from the last three hundred years of colonization further South. However, over the last decade, the arrival of modern goods had reached even the most remote villages. Whereas the various organic materials that had been put to functional use were entirely biodegradable, now strange modern materials stubbornly refused to degrade when discarded.</p>

    <p>However, the Igorots had not been sitting idly by.</p>
    
    <p>In the Igorot culture, the art of repurposing is highly esteemed— in much the same way that painting or sculpture is in other societies. Consequently, the region had become a hot-bed of up-cycling innovations. In town old tires were being cut up to make remarkably functional chairs and tables. In the mines used dynamite cable was being woven to make traditional backpacks. In the villages straws and wrappers were being used to weave mats, purses, wallets and containers of all kinds.  </p>

   <p>Both myself and Banayan were fascinated and engaged by the local upcycling movement. Whereas Banayan had been developing arts and crafts education, I was involved in improving designs to make saleable products. However, in the face of the ever-growing flow of discarded plastic, our success was limited. As the legal stand-off in Bontoc intensified, we realized that securing plastic out of the environment was far more vital than making or teaching handicrafts. </p>
    
    <p>It just so happened that my colleagues and I had been experimenting with a new   technique from South America in which plastic bottles were packed full of sand to make building blocks. Fortuitously, the river sand pit and the local dump-site were side by side. After making several sand bottle-bricks, we decided to try packing them with plastic instead.</p>

   <p>The experiment was a success! Not only were we able to make bottle-bricks that were just as effective as those packed with sand, we’d been able to secure a great deal of plastic that would have otherwise scattered into the river.</p>

   <p>At my home, I began to experiment with packing my own used plastic into a bottle. I made a small garden with the result. Everyone was delighted. The nearby school, which was struggling to dispose the plastic of hundreds of students, asked me to show them how it was done. After a day of packing plastic, making bricks and building a compost, I and the community were excited to this alternative to burning and dumping plastic in the river.</p>
  
   <p>As, the technique began to spread to other schools, Banayan stepped in. She realized the potential for raising the awareness around the ecological issues. We worked together to create a reporting system and a guidebook. Through her coordination, what was soon to be called ‘ecobricking’, spread out to hundreds of schools in the province.</p>

   <p>And then to thousands.</p>

   <p>With a year, as the entire Northern Philippines department of education, the Catholic and Protestant Churches, and various municipal and provincial governments came on board, ecobricking fast became an alternative for millions of Filipinos to manage their plastic.</p>

   <p>Having played a key role in the genesis of the movement, Banayan and I have watched with both joy and trepidation as it has spread.</p>

   <p>While at first it seemed a great victory that so much plastic was being contained and secured from contaminating the river, the matter was far from settled. As we soon learned, plastic is a multi-faceted phenomenon that, much as we may wish, does not disappear after we dispose of it— nor when we put it in a bottle.</p>

   <p>As the movement spread by word of mouth, we observed that often, in providing a solution for plastic, the continued consumption of plastic was legitimized.</p>

   <p>In some schools we observed a jump in the purchase of soft-drinks in order to procure bottles for ecobricking. In other locations we observed an increase in junk food consumption so that their would be wrappers to pack.<p>

  <p>As hundreds and then thousands of ecobricks were made, we began to observe troubling applications.</p>

  <p>Some local governments put their ecobricks to use in gardens in which they were fully exposed to the sun.  After several years, the bottles had disintegrated and all the plastic inside had scattered.  In other cases, ecobricks were put to use with cement.  It soon became clear that at the end of the construction, the cement would crumble and inevitably rupture the soft plastic of the ecobrick bottle.</p>

    <p>Banayan and I, observing these phenomena in our local communities as well as in the global ecobrick movement, were troubled.  Were ecobricks truly being of ecological service?  Or were they simply delaying the problem?  More troubling, were ecobricks in fact accelerating the consumption of plastic?</p>
      
    <p>Over the last decade these questions have compelled us re-examine not only ecobricks as a 'solution to plastic', but so too what constitutes an 'ecological solution' in the first place.</p>

    <p>As a short-hand for ecological solutions, the term 'green' has come to figure prominently in our reflections and questions.</p> 
    
    <p>In particular: what in fact should green really mean?</p>

    <p>Observing the shortcomings of our ecobricking attempts at green, our suspicion has grown that that solving plastic (and being ‘green’) has little to do with a new and improved technology. Rather, we've come to see that no matter what we do, far more crucial is how and why we do it.</p>

    <p>The culmination of a decade of dialogue between Banayan and I, the Tractatus Ayyew represents our culminating conviction that when it comes to the parameters and principles that guide our how and why, the wisdom traditions of ancient indigenous cultures<a href="#footnotes">¹</a> is of critical modern relevance.</p>

    <p>Our title reflects this intersection of worlds.</p>
    
    <p>In Latin, the word <i>tractatus</i> refers to the philosophical tradition of a treatise— a systematic exposition of a particular concept.  In Kan'kan'ue, the language of the Igorots, the word <i>ayyew</i> refers to the virtue of cyclic ecological integration that guides their culture.</p>

    <p>It is this ayyew ethos which inspires and guides the theory of green and grey presented in the three books of the Tractatus Ayyew ahead.</p>

    <p>In Book One we clear the ground and establish the foundation of our Earth based ethics.</p>

    <p>In Book Two we dedicate a chapter to each of the five Earthen ethics. </p>

    <p>In Book Three we conclude with our five-fold solution for the management of plastic that can be applied to other green-aspiring enterprises.  </p>

    <p>Through its combination of stand-alone chapters and books, the Tractatus Ayyew aims to be a tool kit rather than a manifesto.   It is our hope that with the example of plastic and the guidance of Earthen ethics other seemingly intractably grey domains may transition, with confidence and clarity, to a deep shade of green.</p>

   <!--it has everything to do discarding old errors, upgrading our view of the world and adjusting our process, cycles and systems accordingly.</p>-->
