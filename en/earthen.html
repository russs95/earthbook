<div class="lead-page-paragraph"><p id="1=7-00">
    FOR TOO LONG we have assumed the earth beneath us to be a static and stable constant. In fact, it is anything but.  The flow of cosmic matter and momentum that first formed our planet has never ceased its spin.  With no vestige of a beginning and no prospect of an end<a href="#footnotes" title="Thomas Hutton, 'A Theory of the Earth', Royal Society of Edinburgh, (Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1788) Vol. 1." onclick="openFootnotes()">⁵²</a>, the ever unfolding confluence of Earth’s unique combination of matter and energy, composes a cosmological pattern of process all its own.  Indeed, in our entire galaxy we know of no other entity that has so thoroughly realized the very ecological enrichment to which we now so long to manifest ourselves. </p>
 </div>

 <div class="page-paragraph">

    <p id="1-7-01">Truly, the transformation of our once barren planet into a thriving biosphere is the penultimate example of <i>green</i>.</p>

      <p id="en-1-7-02">In the same way that kincentric societies have been guided by the example of ancient masters of ecological integration, so too can we be guided by the example of Earth. </p>

      <p id="en-1-7-03">Observing the planet’s shift over the eons from barren to bounteous, from grey to green, we can discern an underlying pattern in Earth’s ways.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="As outlined in chapter 6, we take the view of Earth as a self-contained, planetary system in which humans and their systems are subset. In this way, when we allude to <<following Earth's example>> we are mindful of the 'naturalistic fallacy' (i.e. because it is natural to do things a certain way, we ought to do things that way). While this fallacy certainly pertains to is/ought arguments between two independent systems (i.e. 'the human world' and 'the natural world'), the fallacy loses in relevance when one system is acknowledged to be a subset of the other. In such a case, a three part is/ought/if statement is possible on certain characteristics of the whole: a system is a certain way; its parts ought to embody that way if both are to operate as they should. i.e. the wall is solid and strong, and so ought be its bricks if both the bricks and wall are to stand. The plant is growing towards the sun, and so ought its leaves if it is to thrive. Consequently, we categorically avoid the dichotomy of 'natural' systems and human systems. Instead, throughout the Tractatus Ayyew we view human processes as an ecological subset of Earth's biosphere.">⁵³</a>  In the resonance of our scientific and kincentric knowing, we can discern five principles that compose Earth’s underlying pattern of process:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="page-paragraph" style="padding:15px">
      <p id="en-1-7-04">1. <i>Earth’s processes tend towards cycles that spiral.</i></p>
  
      <p id="en-1-7-05">2. <i>Earth’s cycles tend towards the outwards spirals of energy.</i></p>

      <p id="en-1-7-06">3.<i>Earth’s cycles tend towards the inwards spirals of matter.</i></p>
      
      <p id="en-1-7-07">4. <i>Earth’s spirals of energy and matter tend toward diverse systems.</i></p>
      
      <p id="en-1-7-08">5. <i>Earth’s systems tend towards ever greater awareness of their interconnection.</i></p>
</div>

    <div class="page-paragraph">

      <p id="54-up">From organism to ecosystem, from biome to biosphere, we are surrounded with the verdant consequences of these primordial principles unfurling through space and time.  Whether the process is minute or massive, ancient or ongoing, in looking closely, we can glimpse the same Earthen ways reflected and embodied— a microcosm of the macro— within every organism and ecosystem.  Within the life-cycles of everything from a forest to a tree, a bird to a flea, we can observe the tendencies of Earth’s character expressed— a vast symphony of a trillion processes, cycles and systems all tending towards a more diverse, resilient, vibrant, interwoven and hospitable home for us all.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="It is important to note we do not lay any claim to why or how Earth came to its particular cosmological character. We are simply observing the net change of the planet from its barren (grey) state to its biosphere (green) state. Whether Earth’s characteristic ways were laid by coincidence, a divine being, many beings, or a sentient planet is a separate matter.">⁵⁴</a></p>

      <p id="55-up">While there are hints of these tendencies upon other planets, upon ours, they definitively incline the cycles of matter and energy<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Here we are not oblivious to the great extinctions, cataclysms and ice ages that have occurred over Earth’s history. Rather, we are surveying the full history of Earth and observing its net tendencies. We observe that even when great regressions of the biosphere are taken into account, these are secondary to an overall process of greening.
">⁵⁵</a>, setting Earth apart in their expression and consequence.</p>
      
      <p id="en-1-7-09">Yet, Earth, in this way is not an exception to other spheres of matter hurtling through space.  Given the unique coalescence of every planet, each has its own cosmological configuration and unfurling.Yet Earth in this way is not an exception.  From the endless storms of Jupiter, to the endemic volcanoes of Venus, to the very color of Mars, each planet’s character tends towards its own expressions of surface, ocean and atmosphere.</p>

     <p id="56-up">That said, each planet’s tendencies are not hard and fast rules.  Not all Jovian storms turn to giant red spots, not all Venusian mountains erupt and not all Martian rocks are red.  Likewise, not all Earthen systems express Earthen tendencies with equal clarity and consequence.<a href="#footnotes" title="In fact, some processes may in fact run contrary to the overall cyclical tendency. However, these processes are always a minority— otherwise they themselves would be the tendency." onclick="openFootnotes()">⁵⁶</a></p>

     <p id="57-up">In this way, over the eons, certain of Earth's organisms and ecosystems have come to express Earthen tendencies more than others.<a href="#footnotes" title="Although it is beyond the scope of the Tractatus, a logical extension of our argument is that Earth’s patterns are in fact the requisite tendencies for the unfurling of life on any planet. In this interpretation, Earth’s ways are not unique to Earth, but rather Earth embodies the ideal cosmological context for these tendencies to express themselves. While this requires far more proof to be established than is available, should it be true, it would not be antithetical to Earthen ethics developed in the Tractatus Ayyew. Rather it would simply place them in a broader context and provide further substantiation for their merit as ethical guidance for sentient beings.
">⁵⁷</a></p>

     <p id="en-1-7-10">And so too certain human cultures and societies.</p>

     <p id="en-1-7-11">In the next five chapters, we shall examine five Earthen phenomena that have attained an exceptional magnificence in their geometric expression of one of the five facets of Earth’s cosmological character.  With the help of various kincentric cultures and the guidance of contemporary physics, biology and astronomy we will examine the ways of the Igorots, the cycles of the salmon, the manner of mollusks, the process of a coral polyp  and the means of a mycorrhizal forest.  Each shall aid us in discerning the essence of a particular Earthen principle, and together reveal the full character of ecological contribution.</p>

     <p id="en-1-7-12">What we shall call an <i>Earthen ethics.</i></p>

     <p id="en-1-7-13">Applying these Earthen ethics, we can confidently discern and define what is <i>green</i> (what is an ecological contribution) and what is <i>grey</i> (what is not).</p>

     <p id="en-1-7-14">What is green is that which embodies the five-faceted geometry of Earthen principles and leads to processes, cycles and systems that are ever more vibrant, stable, resilient, abundant and conscious.</p>

     <p id="en-1-7-15">What is grey is that which conflicts with any one of the Earthen principles, leading to the opposite— lowering consciousness, reducing biome abundance, vibrancy and stability, and decreasing resiliency. </p>

     <p id="en-1-7-16">Let us move forward now to discern in detail the five parameters of ecological enrichment on planet Earth— the requisite five pillars of a new green age and a thriving common home for all.</p>
