    Three hundred million years ago, Earth’s oceans were full of swimming swirls of spiraling matter.  Just as fish are everywhere in oceans today, so too were ammonites— a now extinct mollusk.  Ammonites thrived in the ancient, more-acidic seas of the Mezoic period.  Well known for its spiral shell, the ammonite had much in common with the mollusks of today.  Like clams and oysters, during its life, the ammonite sieved carbon and calcium out of the water to synthesize its shell.  And just like other mollusks, in death, it would inevitably sink down to the ocean floor<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Fodrie FJ, Rodriguez AB,Gittman RK, Grabowski JH, Lindquist NL,Peterson CH, Piehler MF, Ridge JT. 2017 Oysterreefs as carbon sources and sinks.Proc. R. Soc.B284: 20170891.http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0891">⁷⁹</a>.  Generation after generation, the relentless rain of moluskan matter, accompanied by the carcasses and defecations of other marine creatures, steadily accumulated.  As layer upon layer of fallen life pressed down upon itself, all the matter that an ammonite had gathered over the course of its life was compacted into stone. Over countless life-cycles, the lives of billions of ammonites and trillions of other marine creatures inexorably swirled countless tons of carbon and calcium into geological sequestration— a process that steadily reduced the acidity of the oceans, making them more and more hospitable for other creatures to thrive and diversify.</i>

      <!--THE WAY IN WHICH THE ANCIENT AMMONITE managed it matter to build its own home and steadily enrich the common home that it shared with other creatures, is an example that can guide and inspire us today.  
      
      And by understanding their human example, we gain a new perspective to evaluate our failed attempts to to manage our matter in a truly green way: in particular the modern vitues of "net-zero" and "zero-waste".  However,-->

      TODAY, in its fossilized form, we can hold an ammonite's ecological contribution in the palm of our hand.  The carbon that an ancient ammonite helped to sequester millions of years ago, helped to reduce the ocean's net carbon content, and consequently its acidity— a key role in making the waters more hospitable homes for countless other creatures to thrive.  The way that the molusks in general<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="The Carbon Sequestration Potential of Shellfish, The Fish Site, February 2009 https://thefishsite.com/articles/carbon-sequestration-potential-of-shellfish">⁸⁰</a>) crafted their own home, while also making their habitat more hospitable other creatures, is an example that illustrates and illuminates our third Earthen ethic.  In our last chapter, we saw how the outward spin of <i>energy</i> is characteristic of Earth’s pattern.  Now, looking closely at the manner of the mollusks, we can discern another characteristic spiral— a  tendency to steadily spin the principal elements of a system into concentration and sequestration.  As we shall see, it is a pattern that mirror's Earth's own transition from barren to biosphere. Through the lens of this third Earthen ethic, we shall revisit the way that the Igorot's managed their matter, and observe what both have in common.  Inspired by their ecological integration, we too can follow Earth's example to be sure the way our processes, products and systems manage their carbon and other elements are truly are green.</p>

      <p id="en-2-3-06">However, on each planet, the movement of matter, as it is driven to dissipate the Sun's energy, is unique.  Propelled by each planet's configuration of orbit, spin, chemistry, magnetosphere, mass, momentum and more, vortexes unfold with varying levels of definition and clarity— and with their own unique geometric character. </p>
      
      <p id="en-2-3-07">On Jupiter, gases readily spin together in distinctly whispy spirals, while on its north pole, there are eight vortices surrounding a central vortex, and at the south pole there are six (see figure 1, column 1)<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="'From its pole-to-pole orbit, the Juno spacecraft discovered arrays of cyclonic vortices in polygonal patterns around the poles of Jupiter.

On Saturn, although vortexes are much less defined, on its poles, hydrogen and helium spin in a giant hexagonal storm (see figure 1, column 2).  On Venus a dipolar vortex spins its thick sulfuric acid atmosphere (see fig.1 column 3). On Mars and Neptune, matter spirals but with a barely distinct geometry.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-07b">Meanwhile, on Earth, the unique combination of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen spin with their own characteristic Earthen spiral.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-08">As we saw in Earth's stellar story, the thermodynamic imperative of dissipation, compelled its carbon to come together into more and more complex systems.  Steadily, as early systems unfurled, they gathered the abundant loose carbon from the atmosphere to unfold ever more effective energetic cycles and material forms out the readily available elements.</p>
     
     <p id="en-2-3-09">Organisms such as cells, plants and the ammonite!</p>
     
     <p id="en-2-3-10">But also, just like trees, fish and fungi.  Steadily, as generations of mollusks, plants, fungi animals and insects lived and died, the matter that they had concentrated into their forms fell to the ground.  Steadily, layer upon layer of fallen life, was covered up by the fall of the next.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-11">Although these organisms all added carbon into the air through their exhalations, with each cycle of life and death, they tended to concentrate more carbon into themselves than they let out loose.  Over hundreds of millions of years, the inexorable accumulation of these ancient organisms became compacted deep underground.  In the case of the ammonite, as more and more of their carbonate shells, bodies and excretions fell downwards, it meant that more and more carbon was being effectively subtracted from the waters.  This in turn enabled the ocean's to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere above.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-12">With the life cycles of innumerable organisms systematically subtracting more carbon than they added, soon vast quantities were stored out of the atmosphere and into geological storage.  With so much carbon sequestered into geological storage, the carbon content of Earth's oceans reduced.  This enabled the oceans to absorb more of the planet's atmospheric carbon-- leading into a decline in ocean acicity and atmospheric green-house effects.</p>

     <!-- FOOTNOTE 
      
      <p id="en-2-3-13">While its impossible to determine today just how much carbon the ammonites themselves were responsible for, studies of modern mollusks show that the potential is significant.  In the case of the forests of the carboniferous period, 100 million years before, the net substraction was dramatic.  The subtraction of carbon from the cycles of plants, trees, forests and algae was so substantial that it lead to million year ice ages.  Despite such extremes however, this pattern of steady subtraction served to counter balance inevitable planetary moments of release– such as forest fires, volcanoes and massive meteor strikes.  In this way, over the course of the planet's last 600 million years, as trillions of carbon-based organisms lived and died, on the whole, the planet's climate tended steadily towards stabilization.</p> -->

     <p id="en-2-3-14">And even more life was able to flourish!</p>

     <!-- use this later  cd 
      
      <p id="en-2-3-00"> Over time the spiral of the Ammonite’s life-cycle lead to the sequestration of countless tons of carbon into geological storage.  Today, parts of Earth's vast limestone deposits are their legacy— as well as atmosphere and oceans containing far less carbon than before.  In this way,  the Ammonite made not only made their own home, they made their common home livable and more hospitable for others.</p>-->

     <p id="en-2-3-15">A similar pattern of matter management is found in the way that the Igorot people of Northern Luzon integrated with the ecosystems of which they were a part.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-16">As we saw in our earlier chapter, the lives of the Igorot people of Northern Luzon are guided by their <i>ayyew</i> ecological ethos.  This ethos inspired the way that the Igorots viewed the matter that passed through their hands and bodies.  No matter the matter, it represented an opportunity for better and more effecting cycling.  Consequently, from farming, to eating; from discarding, to defecating, the Igorots strove to spiral their matter towards enrichment.<a href="#footnotes" onclick="openFootnotes()" title="Russell Maier, 'One Thousand Years Pollution Free: Learning from the Ayyew Ways & Wisdom of the Igorots' (2018, /medium.com/earthen/1000-years-pollution-free)">⁸³</a> but in "logits" (or, roughly translated "fertilizer").</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-17">To this day, many Igorot homes have a <i>lomeng</i>— a submerged enclosure where the household's pig was kept.  However, these were much more than pig pens.  Lomeng were used to deposit everything from overcooked rice, grass clippings.  They were also used as a toilet.  The pigs would consume almost everything given to them.  They would grow fat and provide rich manure to fertilize the families gardens and fields— essentially concentrating the various forms of carbon biomass given to them into even more concentrated and nutrient rich biomass.</p>
     
     <p id="en-2-3-18">Consequently, over many cycles of crops, pigs and humans the Lomeng lead to the steady concentration of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus— the principal elements of their ecosystem—  back into the soil.  This lead to ever more fertile fields and healthy and well nourished Igorot communities.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Today, we have much to learn from the Igorots example of enriching ecological integration.  Like them, and like the Ammonite and Earth, we too can manage our matter in a green way.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-19">Just as Earth tended its cycles towards the inward spiral of matter, so must we intend and achieve the same with our own.  Only when the intention and the result of our cycles is the net concentration of their active elements, are we following Earth's pattern.  Only then is the third Earthen ethic met. Only then can our acts and enterprises be considered ecological contributions— and green.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-20">This third earthen ethic provides a geometric means of evaluating the management of matter within our human processes. </p>

     <!--

       It applies to the principal elements used in any of our processes— but most notably to our usage of carbon.
       
     <p id="en-2-3-00">For the last century, we can observe that our modern civilization's usage of carbon has been in opposition to the Earth's pattern.  The extraction and burning of Earth's ancient compacted carbon deposits (w)hat we have called "fossil fuels") has come to power our modern nations.  From dense geological deposit to the fumes emitted by their burning, our process of using carbon has decidedly been one of dispersal.

      As we send our used plastic off to far off factories to be processed, dumped or incinerated, our industrial processes begin again with new material. 
     </p>

       <p id="en-2-3-21">Perhaps the most tangible example of our modern use of carbon, is of our plastic.  As we saw in Plastic's Stellar story, plastic was at first a by-product of the refinement of petroleum to make fuels.   Having originated from a concentrated form under the earth to be dispersed over the surface of the planet, we can clearly observe that the outwards spin of plastic industrial cycles is contrary to the inward spiral of the Earth's.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-22">Today, to be green modern enterprises attempt to mitigate this outward spiral of inevitable pollution with goals such as "net-zero" and "zero-waste".</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-23">In so far as these goals seek to reduce and balance the outputs of our process to zero, they are a step in the right direction.  However, within the context of Earthen system, we can now see that they are geometrically flawed.</p>
     -->
   
<!-- 
     <p id="en-2-3-34">No matter how much a system may reduce its carbon emissions, no matter how much a system may reduce its waste output, if these systems still have a net carbon emission or a net waste output, no matter how small, the system fails to folow Earth's example.  Afterall, these emissions or wastes indicates the system's outward spiral geometry.  And after many cycles and many replications, any seemingly small amount will inevitably compound into overwhelming significance: pollution and contimination.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-24">Just the opposite happens in Igorot systems: once the nutrient energy of the matter that passed through their hands had been extrated, the principal elements tended to be returned to the cycles of life in a denser form than before.  With the rice plants extracting loose carbon from the air, condensing it in to rice, and Igorot cultivation continuing the downward spiral into further concentration, steadily more and more carbon, phosoforus, nitrogen and other elements are sequestered into biomass and into the soil itself making it more feritle and rich.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-25">As we develop enterprises, technologies and industries to be green, the requisite geometry by which they must manage their matter is clear.</p> -->

     <p id="en-2-3-26">Whether the process’s primary element is carbon or calcium, lithium or silicone, the process must embody an inward spiral in its management of matter.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-27">First, the process must accumulate its principal elements.  Second, the cycle of the process must concentrate these elements.  Third, the spiral of these cycles must then lead to the net-subtraction of the element and tend, over the long-term, to its sequestration.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-28">Cyclical, for-Earth processes that can achieve this, embody both the inward spiral of their matter and the outward spiral of their energy and fulfill the first three Earthen ethics.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-30">In so doing, the tension between their distribution of energy and their concentration of matter, unfurls through space and time.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-31">Like those cycles of the Igorot, Salmon, Ammonite and the Earth.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-32">In sharp contrast to the desolation that unfolded on the surfaces our fellow planets, the geometry of this Earthen double spiral has led to just the opposite: </p>

     <p id="en-2-3-33">A never ending spin towards ever more vibrant and diverse systems.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-34">Our fourth Earthen ethic.</p>
