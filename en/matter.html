    Three hundred million years ago, Earth’s oceans were full of swirls of spiralling matter, swiming freely about.  Just as fish are ubiquitous our oceans today, for millions of years so too were the ancient ammonite in every ancient ocean.  Famous for its spiral fossilized shell, this now extinct creature had much in common with the mollusks that we know today.  Similar to clams and oysters, the ammonite sieved loose minerals such as carbon and calcium out of the water to synthesis its shell.  And just like the mollusks of today, at the end of its life, it shared the same fate: an inevitable fall to to the ocean floor.  Over time, a relentless rain of ammonites, as well as the carcasses of other creatures and their excretions, accumulated at the bottom of the ocean.  As layer upon layer of sediment pressed down upon another, steadily, all the carbon and calcium that each ammonite had gathered was compacted into stone. Over millions of years, the lives of trillions of ammonites, spun countless tons of bicarbonate into geological sequestration.  Not only did this contribute to the vdast limestone deposits of today, over time, this relentless subtraction of carbon reduced the net acidity of the oceans, making the waters more hospitable, and livable for countless other creatures. <a href="#footnotes">⁵⁸</a> </i>

    THE WAY IN WHICH THE ANCIENT AMMONITE thrived, while steadily enriching the common home that it shared with other creatures, is an example that can guide and inspire us today.  In our last chapter, we saw how the outward spin of <i>energy</i> is characteristic of Earth’s pattern.  Now, looking closely at the life cycle pattern of the ammonite (as it represents a similar pattern of countless other Earthen creatures) we can discern the characteristic spin of Earth's <i>matter</i>.  In particular, the way Earthen systems tend to spin matter inwards, towards concentration. As we shall see, with the help of this third earthen Ethic we can further make sense of the enrichment wrought by by kincentric cultures as they integrated with their ecosystems.  And, we gain a new tool to evaluate our modern management of matter (most notably our carbon), to be sure our processes, products and systems are truly are green.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="page-paragraph">

      <p id="en-2-3-00">Let us return one more time to Earth's primordial beginnings for a closer look.</p>

      <p id="en-2-3-00">As we saw in Earth's stellar story, the solar systems planets formed five billion years ago as interstellar debris steadily swirled together-- a coalescence of matter that has in fact, has never ceased. 

      <p id="en-2-3-00">On our planet, as on others, geology, atmosphere and oceans all continue to spin and spiral– powered by the ever arriving blaze of the sun and added to by an unending rain of meteors of all shapes and sizes.<a href="#footnotes" title="text", onclick="openFootnotes()">⁶⁰</a></p>

      <p id="en-60-up">However, on each planet, the way that this matter comes together is unique.  On each planet, vortexes unfold with their own unique geometry determined by their unique combination of matter and energy (its orbit, spin, chemistry, magnetosphere, mass, momentum and more). From Venus sulfuric acid dipole vortexes, to Jupiters' polygonal vortex patterns of hydrogen and helium, to Saturn's hexagonal hydrogen polar vortex, the way each planet spirals its matter is a direct reflection of its cosmological character-- in particular the swirl of its primary elements.</p>
      
      <p id="en-2-3-00">Just as on Venus, Jupiter and Saturn the prevalence of certain principal elements— sulfur, hydrogen and helium— dominated and determinin the character of their spirals, on Earth the spin of carbon, oxygen and hydrongen has determined ours.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">On Earth, the cycles of atmosphere and ocean that emerged on Earth's surface tended in their own Earthen direction.  In particular, towards ever better dissipations of the Sun's energy by concentrating carbon into ever more complex systems.  Steadily, as early cellular systems unfurled, they figured out how to gather the abundant loose carbon from the atmosphere to build their bodies.  Steadily, as early organisms evolved, their own intricate patterns of carbon began to unfurl.</p>
     
     <p id="en-2-3-00">Like the ammonite!</p>
     
     <p id="en-2-3-00">But also, just like trees, fish and fungi.  Steadily, as generations of mollusks, plants, fungi animals and insects lived and died, their biomass, whether on land or sea, was covered up by the fall of the next.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Although these organisms all added CO2 back into their environment through their exhalations and excretions, with each cycle of life and death, they tended to concentrate more carbon than they let out loose.  Be it on the floor of an ocean or  a forest, slowly and steadily, layers of life were buried one upon the other.  Over hundreds of millions of years, the inexorable accumulation of these ancient organisms became compacted deep underground.  In the case of the ammonite, as their shells, bodies and excretions fell downwards, more and more carbon was subtracted and secured under the ocean floor.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">With the life cycles of innumerable organisms systematically subtracting more carbon than they added, soon vast quantities were stored out of the atmosphere and into geological storage.  With so much carbon removed from Earth’s early atmosphere, its ocean's reduced in acidity and the atmospheric carbon content declined.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">During the reign of the Ammonites, the subtraction of carbon from the cycles of plants, trees, forests and algae was so substantial that it lead to million of year ice ages.  Despite such extremes however, this pattern of steady subtraction served to counter balance inevitable planetary moments of release– such as forest fires, volcanoes and meteor strikes.  In this way, over the course of the planet's last 600 million years, as trillions of carbon-based organisms lived and died, on the whole the planet's climate tended steadily towards stabilization.  </p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">And even more life was able to flourish in abundance and diversity.</p>

     <!-- use this later  cd 
      
      <p id="en-2-3-00"> Over time the spiral of the Ammonite’s life-cycle lead to the sequestration of countless tons of carbon into geological storage.  Today, parts of Earth's vast limestone deposits are their legacy— as well as atmosphere and oceans containing far less carbon than before.  In this way,  the Ammonite made not only made their own home, they made their common home livable and more hospitable for others.</p>-->

     <p id="en-2-3-00">This dynamic of matter management can be fund in kincentric cultures and cyclocentric nations around the world.(see our definition of the term cyclocentic in Chapter 5)</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">As we saw earlier, the lives of the Igorot people of Northern Luzon are guided by their <i>ayyew</i> ecological ethos.  This ethos guided the way that the Igorts managed the matter that passed through their hands and bodies. From farming, to eating; from discarding, to defecating, the way in the Igorots embodied ayyew in their process resulted not in "waste" (their is no such concept in the Igorot language) but in "logits" (or, roughly translated "fertilizer").</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Each Igorot household home had a <i>lomeng</i>— a submerged enclosure where the family pig was kept.  However, these were much more than pig stalls.  Lomeng were used to discard everthing from overcooked rice, grass clippings.  They were also used as a toilet.  The pigs would consume almost everything given to them!  They would grow fat and provide rich manure to fertilize the families gardens and field— essentially concentrating the various forms of carbon biomass given to them into even more concentrated and nutrient rich biomass.</p>
     
     <p id="en-2-3-00">Over, countless lifecycles of humans and pigs, this process lead to the steadily concentration of carbon, nitogen and phosphos— the prinpal elements of their ecosystem.  This lead to ever more fertile fields and healthy and well nourished Igorot communities.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">As we strive to ensure our human enterprises are green, the ways of Igorots, the Ammonites and of the Earth show us the way forward.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Just as the Earth tended it’s cycles towards the inward spiral of matter, so must we intend and achieve the same with our own.  Only when the intention and the result of our cycles is the net concentration of their active elements, are we following the pattern of our planet.  Only then is the third Earthen ethic met. Only then can our acts and enterprises be considered ecological contributions— and green.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">This third earthen ethic provides a geometric means of evaluating the management of matter within our human processes.  It applies to the principal elements used in any of our processes— but most notably to our usage of carbon.</p>

     <!--
     <p id="en-2-3-00">For the last century, we can observe that our modern civilization's usage of carbon has been in opposition to the Earth's pattern.  The extraction and burning of Earth's ancient compacted carbon deposits (w)hat we have called "fossil fuels") has come to power our modern nations.  From dense geological deposit to the fumes emitted by their burning, our process of using carbon has decidedly been one of dispersal.</p>
     -->
     <p id="en-2-3-00">Perhaps the most tangible example is that of our modern plastic.  As we saw in Plastic's Stellar story, plastic is a by-product of the refinement of petroleum to make fuels.  As we send our used plastic off to far off factories to be processed, dumped or incinerated, our industrial processes begin again with new material.  Having originated from a concentrated form under the earth to be dispersed over the surface of the planet, we can clearly observe that the outwards spin of plastic industrial cycles is contrary to the inward spiral of the Earth's.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">What then are we to make of modern attempts at green— such goals as "net-zero" and "zero-waste"?</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">In so far as these goals seek to reduce and balance the outputs of our process to zero, they are a step in the right direction.  However, from an Earthen perspective we can see that they are fundatmentally insufficient.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">As we saw in the example of the Igorots, every molecule of matter in the processes of the Igorots, once its nutrient energy had been extracted, was returned back into the cycles of life around in them in a denser form than before.  With the rice plants extracting loose carbon from the air, condensing it in to rice, and Igorot cultivation continuing the downward spiral into further concentration, steadily more and more carbon was sequestered into biomass and into the soil itself.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">As we develop enterprises, technologies and industries to be green, the requisite geometry by which they must manage their matter is clear.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Whether the process’s primary element is carbon or calcium, lithium or silicone, water or cement, the process must embody the third Earthen Ethic.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">First, the process must accumulate its principal elements.  Second, the cycle of the process must concentrate these elements.  Third, the spiral of these cycles must then lead to the net-subtraction of the element and tend, over the long-term, to its sequestration.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Circular, for-Earth processes that can achieve this, embody both the inward spiral of their matter and the outward spiral of their energy and fulfill the first three Earthen ethics.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">In so doing, the tension between their distribution of energy and their concentration of matter, unfurls through space and time.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Like those cycles of the Igorot, Salmon, Ammonite and the Earth.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">In sharp contrast to the desolation that unfolded on the surfaces our fellow planets, the geometry of this Earthen double spiral has led to just the opposite: </p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">A never ending spin towards ever more vibrant and diverse systems.</p>

     <p id="en-2-3-00">Our fourth Earthen ethic.</p>
