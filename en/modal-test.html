             <p>Through this spiral, the salmon proliferated in rivers up and down the North Pacific coast of America, contributing to the inexorable enrichment of the land.</p>
        
             <p>Today, <!--as we focus our efforts on reducing the ecological harm of our modern enterprises,-->as we strive to define the meaning of green for our modern endeavours and enterprises, it is critical to recall that humans also played a part in the flourishing of the America's continental coast over the last twelve thousand years.</p>
        
             <p>Over the mellenia, nations such the Wetʼsuwetʼen have lived side by side the salmon.  Seeing the salmon as ecological elders, they were able to learn from them.  Over the generation they wove the salmon's pattern of energy management into the stories, morals and languages of their culture-- which in turn had significant impact on the ecosystem of which their society was part.</p>
