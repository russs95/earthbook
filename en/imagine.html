     <div class="lead-page-paragraph">
        IMAGINE A WORLD where the very way we live is steadily enriching the ecosystems of which we are part.  It is a world where our households and communities, just by thriving, make the biosphere a more abundant, vibrant and hospitable home for us and our fellow creatures.  While the minimization of our harm to ecosystems remains a priority, in this world it has become an afterthought: above all we endeavor to maximize our ecological contributions.  To do so, we manage the matter and energy that flows through our process, cycles and systems accordingly.  No longer do our enterprises strive to operate merely in circles—  so too do they spiral; with each spin overpaying their ecological debts and dispersing their surpluses.   No longer do our industries merely reduce the amount of carbon and other elements they let loose— so too do they catch more than they release.  No longer do we merely admire the tapestry of life around us— so too do we play an active role in its diversification and vitalization.  As we thrive together in this common home, the awareness of our ecological interconnection ever augments, and with it, the sync of our cycles of enterprise and ecosystem, economy and biome, humanity and biosphere— a harmony rising up with us towards the stars. 
     </div>


    <div class="page-paragraph">

      <p>Today, as we become more and more aware of the degradation and depletion inherent in our modern world, we yearn to amend our ways and to do better.  As we grow ever more united in our longing to manifest a more harmonious ecological age, it has never before been more important to recognize that the foundations of such a world have already been laid.  Dismissed and all but forgotten by our modern civilization, nations ancient and ongoing have long mastered their ecological integration to achieve the very heights of social and ecological harmony, abundance and vitality to which we now aspire.  To the extent that we can recognize these enlightened moments, we can imagine our own.  And insofar as we can imagine, our realization of such a world is not nearly as distant as many of us despair.
      </p>


      <p>Inspired by the verdant legacy of Banayan’s people, the Igorots of Northern Luzon<a id="3-up"></a><a href="#3-down">³</a>, she and I have to come to see that the potential for ecological contribution unites us all— and even more so, our longing for it. </p>

      <p>Across cultures and continents, as humans we long to contribute to that which we are part:  to sync with those with whom we sing; to harmonize with those with whom we relate; to enrich the communities in which we partake.  Consequently, as the parts we play in our local ecosystems and global biomes become clear, so too does our yearning to participate positively— to enhance our sync and harmony with them; to enrich their diversity, vibrancy and abundance. 
      </p>

      <p>Indeed, Banayan and I have come to see that the transition to households, communities and enterprises that are in-and-of-themselves ecological contributions is the next stage of an epic planetary story whose direction is, quite literally, in our hands.</p>

      <p>So how do we arrive at this thriving common home for all that that we all long to see?</p>

      <p>One word:</p>

      <p>Plastic.</p>

      <p>Therein this problematic modern material lies our way forward.</p>

      <p>As it must be. </p>
      
      <p>Gardeners have long observed that the problem is always the solution—  weeds, pests and pollutants are always, with a shift of perspective and approach, the very nutrients, fertilizers and medicines that bring a struggling garden to thrive.<a id="4-up"></a><a href="#4-down">⁴</a></p>

      <p>Like nothing else, plastic embodies the definitive facets of our modern moment.   Derived from ancient fossilized carbon, plastic allows us to touch the primordial story that has enabled our own.  Bought and sold, plastic is a physical manifestation of the petro-capital economy that powers our global age.  Crafted by humans, entirely for humans, plastic is a shimmering reflection of our modern, human centered civilization.</p>

     <p>In this way, our plastic is in fact a mirror. </p>

     <p>And an opportunity.</p>
     
     <p>By confronting plastic's full billion year story, we can face our own within the same frame.</p>

     <p>Then, in seeing our reflection with unprecedented lucidity, we can know our plastic— and ourselves— anew.</p>

     <p>Above all, we can renew our ecological understanding of positive human participation: what green should really mean.</p>

     <p>Banayan and I, in struggling to manage our own plastic positively, have come to see that the current concept of green is lacking and incomplete.  Seen through the lens of the  ecological ayyew ethos of her people, we observe that the modern ethic of green is merely about reducing harm— while the concept of contribution has remained all but un-imagined.  It is a view of human ecological potential that sharply contradicts the lived experience of Banayan and her people.</p>

     <p>As we shall see in the chapters ahead, ecological contribution has in fact been the overwhelming tendency on Earth— a unique planetary pattern of matter and energy that, from the very beginning, has permeated all of Earth's processes, cycles and systems.</p>

     <p>And our own.</p>

     <p>To the extent that this Earthen pattern has been reflected within the values and virtues of certain cultures, the societies that have ensued have systematically enriched the ecosystems of which they are a part.</p>

     <p>Conversely, to the extent that a culture’s pattern has differed, systematic depletion and degradation have been the inexorable result.</p>

     <p>The discernment of this Earthen pattern, shall be our chief task in the Tractatus Ayyew.</p>

     <p>Through the combination of our two ancestral perspectives, Banayan’s Igorot heritage and my European, her indigenous culture and my settler, her agrarian upbringing and my industrial, we will investigate the shortcomings of our modern ethical understanding. In particular, the long buried metaphysical misconceptions at the very root of all modern ecological malaise.</p>

     <p>With ancient error excised, we shall then lay out a new theory of green based upon the cosmological character of our planet.</p>

     <p>Guided by the insights of great green nations, the ways of magnificently contributive creatures and the latest insights of scientists, we shall lay out each of the principles that composes the Earth’s five-fold pattern of ecological enrichment.</p>

     <p>The resulting Earthen ethics will help us to make sense of our modern processes, technologies and enterprises— a means by which we can discern that which is enriching and what is depleting; that which is green and what is grey; that which is a contribution— and that which is not.</p>

     <p>But more importantly, guided by the Earth’s example, can move forward with unprecedented clarity and confidence to embody the geometry of contribution in all our processes, cycles and systems.</p>

     <p>Starting with that troublesome material we so love to hate.</p>
