				<p>Ten years ago, Banayan Angway and I met in the land of her people, the Igorots, in the Northern Luzon in the West Philippines Sea.  We immediately connected around a shared a resolve to stem the flow of plastic pollution spewing into the region’s river.  With our vastly different backgrounds, it was an unlikely collaboration that was kindled. However, from it emerged a simple and practical plastic management methodology that would spread across the mountainous region from village to village.  Later our variation of ‘ecobricking’, would spread across the Philippines and other South East Asian countries. </p>
			</div>
	
			<div class="page-paragraph">
                <p>Ever since, we’ve endeavored to understand what we began.  In particular our growing suspicion that solving plastic has little to do with improving our technologies, and a lot more to do with advancing our understanding of the world.  </p>

                <p>The result of a decade of reflection, the Tractatus Ayyew represents our culminating conviction of the critical relevance of indigenous wisdom1 to our modern ecological challenges.</p>

                <p>In Latin, the word tractatus refers to the philosophical tradition of a treatise— a systematic exposition of a particular concept.  In Kan’kan’ue, the word Ayyew refers to the virtue of cyclic ecological integration that guides the culture of the Igorot people. </p>

                <p>It is this ayyew ethos, and our experience of it, which inspires the theory of green and grey presented in the chapters ahead—   what we call an <i>Earthen ethics.</i></p>

                <p>In the chapters ahead, the laying out of our theory will unfold much like the planting of a tree.</p>

                <p>Just as a seed succinctly sums up the essence of the plant it will become, we begin by providing a short sentence, a long sentence and a paragraph that define and describe Earthen Ethics.</p> 

                <p>In Book One we clear the ground to root our central premise of an Earth based ethics.</p>

                <p>In Book Two we branch out to describe each of the five Earthen ethics.</p>
                
                <p>In Book Three we top off the theory with our proposed green solution for plastic.</p>

                <p>As the Tractatus unfurls, you’ll quickly note that the theme of plastic is central.  Using plastic as an example of how something that is polluting may be transformed into something that is healing and enriching, we aim to provide an example of how Earthen ethics may be applied more broadly.</p>

                <p>In this way, the Tractatus Ayyew truly aims to be more a multi-part tree than a singular theory or manifesto.</p>

                <p>While the Tractatus progresses sequentially, each chapter is written as a standalone essay that represents one facet Earthen ethics.  This way, much as a tree’s leaves can be used to make a tea, its bark a tincture and its flowers a poultice, each chapter’s argument may be readily referenced to address particular fallacies, issues and arguments.</p>

                <p>To facilitate sharing, each chapter is maintained on the earthen.io website on its own webpage (for example, this particular section can be found at https://earthen.io/preface).  </p>

                <p>To represent the logic and progression of the theory, each chapter’s first page begins with a mandalic representation of its place within the whole.</p>

                <p>To enable collaborative improvement, translation and cultural contextualization, each chapter’s code and content is maintained in a github open-source repository. Fixes, updates, improvements and translation can be pushed by the reader.  New versions and translations may be forked.</p>
