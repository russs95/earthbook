<h1>Publish Your Book as An Earthbook</h1>

<p>The Earthbook source code is developed from the ground up to be replicated to enable anyone anywhere to publish their work in a way that emobdies regenerative principles and is Earth, reader and writer friendly.  You may do so on your own, or enlist the help of the Earthbook developer team to do so for you.  Either way, a completed, ready-t0-go manuscript is required!</p>

<h2>Fork it</h2>
<p>This is the simplest, DIY way to go.  Using a github account, simply fork this project into your own repository.  Replace the content of the Tractatus Ayyew with your own.
